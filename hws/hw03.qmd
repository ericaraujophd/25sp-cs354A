Grading Rubric: 25 points total

-   5 pts: `insert()` correct
-   5 pts: `contains()` correct
-   4 pts x 3 = 12 pts: traversals are correct
-   3 pts: code is neat and clean (hospitable)

Ways students lost points in the past:

-   -1: `Node::contains` has to RETURN the value gotten from recursive calls of contains
-   -2: `insert()` should be recursive;
-   -1: `insert()` should throw an exception when item is already in tree
-   -2: very poor indentation
-   -2: `traversePostorder` and `traverseInorder` should call themselves, not traversePreorder
-   -2: `Node::traverseInOrder` needs to process item in the *middle* (and use `processItem` method) insert
