Welcome to CS354 - Database Management Systems! This is your first homework, and you will be guided through the steps you need to take to complete it.

## Objectives:

In this exercise, you will:

1.  Show you understand how SELECT queries work for different tables.
2.  Show you learned how to visualize data by filtering rows and columns according to what is required.
3.  Show you are able to follow instructions and navigate in a given database.

## To Moodle!

You will log in to [Calvin's Moodle](https://moodle.calvin.edu/){target="_blank"}, enter the course's virtual classroom, and find a task named "Homework 1." Follow the steps outlined there. Remember that we are using CodeRunner, a Moodle plugin that allows students to execute SQL queries and receive automatic feedback.

You may find this first assignment a bit challenging, but I will give you extra time to complete it so that you have enough time to get acquainted with the system.
