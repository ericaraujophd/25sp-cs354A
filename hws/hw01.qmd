## Grading Rubric

20 pts total:

-   1: isEmpty() is correct
-   1: isFull() is correct
-   2: peekTop()
-   2: push()
-   2: pop()
-   2: peekTop(), explicit-value constructor, pop(), and push() all throw an exception correctly.
-   8: thorough tests for Queue class.
-   2: code is hospitable (perfectly indented, etc.)

Ways students lost points in the past:

-   -4: missing tests for Queue
-   -4: missing implementation for Queue
-   -2: Your Queue::remove deletes the whole Queue, and the test did not catch this
-   -7: Queue does not compile and no tests for it.
-   -3: Queue::peekBack, ::peekFront, ::add, ::remove, ::isEmpty, and ::Queue to a "myList" field, which does not exist. Missing implementation for destructor
-   -1: Missing test for Queue::remove
-   -1: Need to decrease size in Queue::remove
-   -2: Queue::add does not properly keep list linked, and tests do not catch this (try an add followed by a remove followed by a check--it won't work)
