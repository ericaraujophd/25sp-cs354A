## Objectives

In this exercise, you will:

- Use the STL set container to store a set of values.
- Use the STL map container to create an associative array whose keys are string values, and whose values are sets of strings.
- Use iterators to access the items in these containers.


## Introduction

This lab/project has you creating a simple database of movies and the actors in the movies. Then the user of the program can choose to: 

- Show all movies
- Show all actors in a movie
- Show all movies an actor was in.
- The main data structure you'll create is an STL map that maps:

```
movie name → set of actors in the movie.
```

This is a complex data structure: each entry in the map contains a set (Thus, we'll have a binary search tree of binary search trees).

We'll use the Bridges database of movie information. When you get the information from the [Bridges API](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/classbridges_1_1dataset_1_1_movie_actor_wikidata.html), you get a vector of objects of type `MovieActorWikidata`. Each object contains a movie and an actor in the movie (among other things). If you printed out those two things from `MovieActorWikidata` objects, you might see these values.

```
Movie: Young at Heart   	  Actor: Alan Hale, Jr.
Movie: Wichita 			      Actor: Carl Benton Reid
Movie: We're No Angels		  Actor: Aldo Ray
Movie: Young at Heart		  Actor: Doris Day
Movie: Wichita			      Actor: Joel McCrea
etc...
```

Thus, you see that the objects are not in any order, and do not have all the actors in a movie in each object. To get all actors for a movie, you'll have to iterate over all the elements of the vector and learn 1) all the movies, and 2) all the actors in the movies.

Note that sometimes an actor is listed multiple times for a movie. But, because we are using an `STL set`, it automatically handles attempts to insert an element multiple times.

## Menu

The application presents a menu from which the user can select the operation s/he wishes to perform. To validate a user's menu-choice, our project uses a tree-based data structure -- the `STL set`. For example, if the valid menu choices are *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *f*, and *q*, and we store these choices in a set named `myValidChoices`, then we might (simplistically) visualize this set as follows:

![](/images/labs/lab11-bst.png)

To determine whether or not a character is present in this set, the STL `find(value)` method does a binary search down through this tree until it either locates value, or reaches the bottom of the tree. It should be evident that the maximum time to search is *O(lg(n))*, where *n* is the number of items in the set.

The exercise will provide you with a "skeleton" application, which you will then complete by adding additional functionality.

## Getting Started

Accept the [invitation from github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZtXfpjDl){target="_blank"} and use git clone, as usual.

Edit the **README.md** file to add both your names and your partner's, and share the git repo, as usual.

## Part I. The Menu Class

When dealing with menu-driven systems, one thing that can go wrong is if the user enters an invalid choice -- something that is not on the menu. When this happens, the program must detect it and take remedial action.

One way to detect such a problem is to build a **Menu class** that, besides "remembering" its menu, "remembers" its set of valid menu choices. Then when the user enters a choice, we can validate their choice by checking whether or not their choice is an element of that set.

As you can see, our Menu class contains two instance variables: a string storing the menu, and a set to store those menu choices that are valid:

```cpp
string myValue;             // the menu that is displayed
set<char> myValidChoices;   // the valid menu choices
```

Save/compile your project, and verify that everything compiles without errors.

### The Menu Constructor
The Menu constructor currently initializes our `myValue` member; it must also initialize `myValidChoices` so that it stores the valid menu choices. To do so, we can use the `insert()` method:

```cpp
setVariable.insert(value);
```

that inserts a single value into a set.

In **Menu.cpp**, add `insert()` calls to make `myValidChoices` represent the set {'a', 'b', 'c', 'q'}.

### The `Menu::containsChoice()` Method

To let a program conveniently check whether or not a given character is a valid menu choice, the Menu class provides a boolean method `containsChoice(choice)` that returns **true** if and only if choice is a valid menu choice. Currently, this method is a stub-definition that returns **false**. Your next task is to revise this stub so that it returns **true** if and only if choice is in the set `myValidChoices`.

We can accomplish this using the `find()` method.

Save/compile your project, and when it is free of compilation errors, run the program. When it is free of errors, go on.

When you run your program, you will need to provide your Bridges UserName and Id on the command line: e.g., 

```bash
./movies CS112StudentUsingBridges 123555666
```

## Part II. The App Class

The file **App.h** contains the declaration of class App. This class uses an STL map to store (movieName, set of actors) pairs:

```cpp
map<string, set<string>> movies_by_name;   // key is movie name; value is set of actors' names.
```

Note that the code actually reads like this:

```cpp
db_type movies_by_name;
```

In order to not have to type `map<string, set<string>>` too often, I created two **typedefs** at the top of **App.h**:

```cpp
typedef map<string, set<string>> db_type;
typedef map<string, set<string>>::iterator db_iter;
```

Now, the code can use `db_type` and `db_iter` instead of `map<string, set<string>>` and `map<string, set<string>>::iterator`, respectively. So much easier to type!


### Constructor

The App constructor has been defined for you. It takes a vector of `MovieActorWikidata` entries as a parameter.

The constructor code contains the algorithm you should implement to process these entries, building up entries in the `movies_by_name` map.

If you use the hint I gave in class about how accessing a map with `[ ]` will either create a new entry or update it if it already exists, then the body of the for loop is one line. Otherwise, the body is about 9 lines, and is very tricky code.

Write the code now. This code will be difficult to test until you implement the next step.

### Show All Movies Option

Implement code for `showAllMovies()`, to iterate through all entries in `movies_by_name`, and print out the movie name and then iterate through all actors for that movie, printing them out. I've indented the actor's name, so the output is more readable. 

You might find it very useful to make the inner loop a separate function. I called that function `showActorsInAMovie()`. It takes an iterator "pointing" to an object from the `movies_by_name` collection, and iterates over the "second" field (a set), printing each actor in the set. If you implement this function, you'll find you can use it again below.

When you think your code is correct (for this and the previous step), try loading all movies from 1955 and printing them all out. The first movie should be:

```
Movie: 5 Against the House
    	Alvy Moore
    	Brian Keith
    	George Cisar
    	Guy Madison
    	Hugh Sanders
    	Jean Willes
    	John Larch
    	John Zaremba
    	Kathryn Crosby
    	Kerwin Mathews
    	Kim Novak
    	Mark Hanna
    	Robert Sampson
    	William Conrad
```

The last movie you should see should look like this:

```
Movie: Young at Heart
    	Alan Hale, Jr.
    	Doris Day
    	Dorothy Malone
    	Elisabeth Fraser
    	Ethel Barrymore
    	Frank Ferguson
    	Frank Sinatra
    	Gig Young
    	Lonny Chapman
    	Robert Keith
```

### Show All Actors For a Single Movie Option

Complete the code in the `getMovienameAndShowActors()` method. If you created a function to show all actors for a given movie, then you are half done already.

### Show All Movies For an Actor Option

Finally, implement this option. Create a set of strings (I called my variable `movies_by_actor`.) And then go through all movies, looking for that actor. When you find him/her, add the movie to the `movies_by_actor`. Then, when you are done, print out the set. 

Here is a sample output:

```
Enter an actor name to show all movies for that actor: Alfred Hitchcock
Rear Window
The Trouble with Harry
To Catch a Thief
```

## Turn In

Submit your project to github as usual. If you worked with your lab partner on the project, make sure you update **README.md** to include both of your names/login-ids.

## Grading Rubric

21 points total:

- Menu class works: 2 pts.
- App constructor: 5 pts.
- Each App menu item: 4 pts each: 12 pts.
- Hospitable code: code is clean and neat, perfectly indented, with good variable names, etc.: 2 pts.

Ways students have lost points in the past:

- -2: showAllMovies needs to show the names of each movie's actors
- -2: getMovieNameAndShowActors implementation is incorrect, the result of movies_by_name.find will return the iterator value you want to pass to showActorsInAMovie, the for loop is unnecessary
- -2: code is very poorly indented
- -2: parameter names are very poorly chosen
