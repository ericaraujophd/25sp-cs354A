To throw an exception when the stack is full, the `push(const Item& it)` method should behave as follows:

```         
If I am full {
    throw a StackException whose method is "push()" and whose message is "stack is full".
}
a. Store it into the entry of myArray whose index is mySize.
b. Add 1 to mySize.
```
