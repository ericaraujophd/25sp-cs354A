The stub of `pop()` should look like this:

```cpp
Item Stack::pop() {
}
```

Because `pop()` is basically the complement of `push()`, and the index of the top item is 1 position "down" from `mySize`, the `pop()` method should behave as follows:

- Subtract 1 from `mySize`.
- Return the entry of `myArray` whose index is `mySize`.
