    "section": "Step 0.2. Instructions",
    "text": "Step 0.2. Instructions\nIn this simulation, you can move your cursor around a two-dimensional “board” and create or delete one of 3 different “elements” – a square of sand, a drop of water, or a block of metal. Here is what happens when each element is created:\n\nMetal: it sticks to the board where you place it.\nSand: it falls down the board, stacking up on Metal or other Sand, or on the bottom. If Sand encounters water below it, the two switch places, so that it seems the sand is falling through the water.\nWater: it falls down the board and fills in any “cups” created by Metal or Sand, or resting on the bottom. If it encounters Metal, Sand, or Water below it, and there is nothing to the left or right of it, it moves sideways left or right, randomly. This makes the water flow around obstacles.\n\n\nIn the image above you can see how Sand stacks on top of Sand and Metal. The Water will fill in any area that is a “cup”. If one were to move the Cursor (the 6-point star) over above the Water that is in the cup in the middle and drop a Sand, it would slide down the board, falling through the Water, leaving a Water up above the level of the Sand. The Water would then randomly move back and forth until falling down to the bottom.\nThe user interface for the “game” is a little strange, IMO. You use arrow keys to move the cursor around – this should all work. Then, you choose W, A, S, or D to choose whether you are in Water mode, Metal mode, Sand mode, or Delete mode. When you hit the space bar, a Water, Metal, or Sand is created, or whatever the cursor on is deleted, if in Delete mode.\nNote that if you move the Cursor on top of a Metal and go into Sand mode, you can replace a metal with a sand – a little strange, but don’t worry about that – it isn’t a bug."

This function takes one parameter – the vector of Game objects – and returns a vector of strings containing all the discovered genres, in sorted order. Make sure you pass in the parameter efficiently (do not use pass-by-value).\nThe function should first create a variable – I called it all_genres – that is a vector of strings. It will hold all the genres seen. Then, the function should loop through all the Game objects in the vector, and for each Game, loop through all genres the game belongs to. For each genre, it should search all_genres. If the new genre has not been seen before, add it to the end of the all_genres vector using push_back().\nAfter getting all genres from all games, you should sort the vector and then return that vector of strings.\nYour main code should print out the genres in a nice list with numbers in front, like this:\nAll genres:\n0.

    "text": "Step 1. Try it out\nIf you are not familiar with “the snake game”, then you can try it out on google. Just type “snake game” into google and it will give you a pop-up game you can try. Use the arrow keys to move the head of the snake and go after the apple in order to make the snake longer and gain points. Don’t run into the edges or the snake itself!\nIn our version of the game, we will allow the snake to wrap round from top to bottom (and vice versa) and left to right (and vice versa). The only way to die is to run into yourself.\nWe will use the Bridges library to visualize the game online. We’ll use the “Game mode” which requires you to start your program then open the browser and connect to your game. You’ll see a button on the web page that looks like this:\n\n\n\nButton to connect to game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBecause we are using the BRIDGES library, you will have to work on machines in the lab!\n\n\nFor our implementation, we’ll use a queue to represent the body of the snake. As the snake moves a new block is added to the end of the queue – which is the front of the snake – and the last block of the body is removed from the tail – which is the head of the queue. Each item in the queue will be a Pair of integers, representing the \\((x, y)\\) location of the block (\\(x\\) is vertical and \\(y\\) is horizontal). So, the snake’s queue will be defined as\nQueue&lt;Pair&lt;int&gt;&gt; snake; // (see line 58 of Snake.h)\nThe only other kinda tricky part of the code is how we grow the snake. The screen is redrawn each frame. A variable, skipDeletingTailNodesCount, exists which keeps track of how many subsequent frames should not delete the tail of the snake. So, if the variable has the value 2, the snake will grow by two new segments, because for the next 2 frames the snake’s tail will not be deleted.\n\nStep 2. Your task\nThere are TODOs littered throughout Snake.cpp. Your task is to replace the TODOs with code. Each TODO contains a description of what your code should do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note about Iterators\n\n\n\nYou will have to write some code to use the iterator class defined inside the Queue class. An iterator is an abstract pointer – meaning that it can be used like a pointer, but isn’t actually a pointer. So, you can get an iterator, it, that “points” to an item in the queue and then get the item itself by doing *it.\nYou can use iterators to walk through the snake object, like this:\nfor (Queue&lt;Pair&lt;int&gt;&gt;::iterator it = snake.begin(); it != snake.end(); it++) {\n      // use it here -- remember it points to an item in the queue, and those items are Pair objects.\n}\n\n\nTo run your program you have to provide two command-line arguments: your Bridges UserName and your Bridges Id. E.g., I run the program this way:\n./snake VictorNorman 1313148564\nRecall that you can get your username and id from the bridges website: http://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/"

The idea is that at each location (starting from the starting point), you record in the stack where you are in the maze and which direction you are facing. If there is a hallway in front of you, you move to that new point and push a new “record” on the stack. Each time you go to a new location, you always look north first, then west, then south, then east. If you get to a location that is a dead end, you pop the stack, thus moving back to a previous location. A dead-end is when you’ve looked all 4 directions and found no opportunity to move forward. Also, as you work your way through the maze, you record which locations you have already visited – and you never visit a location twice.\nWhen you reach the goal, the stack will contain the path from the goal back to the starting point. Each location on the path will also record which direction you moved to get to the next location on the path.\n\nExample\nConsider this example:\nPictorially the maze looks like this, with S being the starting point (at 0, 0) and G being the goal (at 2, 3).\n-------\n|SX  X|\n|   X |\n|X XG |\n|   |\n-------\nAfter the code solves the maze, the stack and pictorial representation look like this:\nFINAL PATH: (2, 3, X) (3, 3, N) (3, 2, E) (3, 1, E) (2, 1, S) (1, 1, S) (1, 0, E) (0, 0, S)\n-------\n|SX  X|\n|pp X |\n|XpXG |\n| ppp |\n-------\nThis maze was read from a file that looks like this:\n4 5\nSX__X\n___X_\nX_XG_\n_____\nThe first row contains the number of rows and columns. The subsequent rows use _ for an empty space, X for a barrier, S for the start, and G for the goal.\nYour task is to implement the code to\n\nRead in a maze from a file.\nImplement the algorithm given below to solve the maze.\nPrint out the stack as you solve the maze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n\n\n\nFor extra credit, you may implement code to print out the maze pictorially, as seen above.\n\n\nThe code you have includes the file maze.cpp, and two sample mazes, maze1.txt and maze2.txt.\n\n\nDetails\nYour implementation should use the STL stack.\nThe main.cpp code contains a definition of a Location class, which stores an x and y location, and a dir, which is the direction you are facing.\nYour main task is to implement the readMazeFromFile() and isReachable() function.

While we have talked in class about “Big Oh” notation, today’s lab should give you some hands-on experience with the difference between an \\(O(1)\\) operation and an \\(O(n)\\) operation.\nFor a given operation and several values of \\(n\\), our basic methodology will be to build a vector of length \\(n\\), measure how long that operation takes for the vector, build a list of length \\(n\\), and measure how long that operation takes for the list. By choosing five different values for n (10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000), we can then plot our measurements and see empirically how fast or slow a given operation is."

    "section": "Experiment 0: Vector Subscript",
    "text": "Experiment 0: Vector Subscript\nThe purpose of this experiment is to get a feel for how to use the Timer class to time the vector subscript operation. This experiment contains a method named timeAccessAtIndex() that uses Timer to measure how long it takes to access the item at a given index in a vector. The run() method calls timeAccessesForVectorOfSize() for various vector sizes. This method calls the timeAccessesAtIndex() method three times, to see how long it takes to access the first, middle and last value in the vector.\nCompile (make all) and run ./lab7.\nTo report your results, create an online spreadsheet – either Google Sheets or online Excel. On the worksheet, write Lab 7: Experiment 0 in the first row; on the next row create column-headings labeled size, first, middle, and last. Then add rows for each vector size (i.e., 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000). For each row size, enter the times your program displayed for accessing the first, middle, and last value in the vector of size size.\nWhen you have entered all of your data, create a well-labeled line chart from your timing results. Your chart should look something like this:\n\nNote these properties of the graph:\n\nThe horizontal scale is logarithmic.\nThe vertical lab gives the units.\nI have chosen to show the values with little circles – you can choose any shape (circle, square, etc.)\n\nAnalysis. On the chart shown above, the data are “noisy” (thanks to our imprecise clock), ranging from a low of 30.7667 nsec to a high of 33.6957 nsec. However the lines are basically flat – there is no significant change to the access time as the vector size increases by orders of magnitudes. If I use the spreadsheet to compute the averages for the first, middle, and last columns, they are all approximately the same. Your chart should be similar. (Note that I ran my tests on my MacBookPro. The values you get on the lab machines may be quite different.)\nThe relative flatness of these lines and their close proximity to one another indicate that the time to perform this operation remains constant as the size of the vector increases. These results thus indicate empirically that the vector subscript operation is an \\(O(1)\\) (i.e., constant time) operation."

However, STL does provide a generic insert() algorithm that we can use for this task. More precisely, the statement:\ninsert(iterator, value);\nwill insert value at the position indicated by iterator.\nAn iterator is an abstract pointer. Every STL container provides at least two methods that return iterators:\n\nbegin(), that returns an iterator to the first item in the container; and\nend(), that returns an iterator to the first location beyond the last item in the container.\n\nThus, we can use the statement:\ninsert(v.begin(), i);\nto prepend the value of our loop-control variable i to our vector.\nOur timeRepeatedPrependUntilVectorIsSize(n) method also uses the STL insert() method.\nYour task is to write two methods that do the same things for lists:\n\ntimePrependToListOfSize(n) that can be used to measure the average time to prepend an item to a list of size n; and\n\n\ntimeRepeatedPrependUntilListIsSize(n) that measures the average time a prepend operation takes as a list grows very large.\n\nUsing the existing Experiment 2 vector methods as a model, write these two methods; then invoke them so that Experiment2 displays the append times for both vectors and lists.\nWhen you have good data, return to your spreadsheet.

    "section": "Part I",
    "text": "Part I\nIn last week’s exercise, we built a simple but useful vector class named Vec, that stored real (i.e., double) values. To make it easy to change the type of items stored in our Vec, we used a typedef of the form:\ntypedef double Item;\nWe then meticulously used the name Item everywhere we would have used the type double. By doing so, a user wanting to use a vector of integers could just modify the typedef:\ntypedef int Item;\nrecompile, and our Vec would be a vector of integers!\nThis approach works fine for simple problems where all of the vectors store the same types of values. However suppose you need vectors of both integer and real items (or some other type of item) in the same program? In this situation, the typedef approach cannot help us – we need a different approach.\nPart I of today’s exercise is to convert our Vec class into a generic container – a container capable of storing any type of item. To do so in C++, we convert the Vec class into a class template. Because we have used the typedef-Item approach to define our Vec class, this conversion is fairly simple.\nThe tests in the provided tests.cpp have not been revised to use a Vec template. You will be changing Vec.h, Vec.cpp, and tests.cpp in today’s exercise.\nAs its name suggests, a class template is a plan or blueprint from which the compiler can build a class. Once we have converted our Vec class into a Vec&lt;Item&gt; template, a user of the class will be able to write:\nVec&lt;int&gt; v1;\nVec&lt;double&gt; v2;\nVec&lt;string&gt; v3;\nGiven these declarations, the C++ compiler will use the Vec&lt;Item&gt; template to build three classes:\n\nA class that is a vector for storing integer values.\nAnother class that is a vector for storing double values.\nAnother class that is a vector for storing string values.\n\nThe compiler will use these behind-the-scenes classes as the types of v1, v2, and v3. For every declaration in which we pass a new type into the template, the compiler will build a new class, and then use that class as the declaration’s type.\nWith that as our introduction, let’s get on with turning our Vec class into a Vec&lt;Item&gt; class template.\n\nStep 1. Converting the Class Declaration\nThe first step in converting a class into a class template is to delete the typedef declaration we used previously – so remove the line defining Item as a double. In its place, we place the phrase template&lt;class Item&gt; immediately before the class declaration:\ntemplate &lt;class Item&gt;\nclass Vec {\n       ...\n};\nDo this now.\nThis revised declaration tells the C++ compiler that\n\nWhat’s coming is a class template, not a class.\nThis template has a single parameter, whose name is Item.\nThe word class before Item indicates that Item represents a type, not a variable or object.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the name Item is an identifier we have chosen, since it is what we used for our typedef. The words template and class are C++ keywords, they cannot be changed.\nOnce this declaration has been processed, the name of the template is Vec&lt;Item&gt;.\n\n\nStep 2. Eliminating the Implementation File\nBecause the C++ compiler uses a template as a blueprint from which it builds a class, the compiler needs to be able to see the entire class – class declaration plus method definitions – when a program using the template is compiled. This means that the entire class template – template declaration plus method definitions – must appear in the header file, in order for a program that #includes the header file to compile, or linking errors will occur. So our next step is to select the method definitions in the implementation file, cut them, and paste them into the header file, between the template declaration and the #endif.\nIn Vec.cpp, select all of the method definitions, cut them (Ctrl-X or Cmd-X) from the .cpp file. Switch to the Vec.h, move the cursor to a point between the end of the template declaration and the #endif, and paste them in (using Ctrl-v).\nIf there are #include directives in the Vec.cpp file that are not in Vec.h (except for Vec.h itself), they will also need to be cut-and-pasted into Vec.h. (It is often necessary to cut-and-paste #include &lt;iostream&gt;.)\nNow that the method definitions have been moved from Vec.cpp to Vec.h, you should delete Vec.cpp from your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that you will need to update your Makefile! Find the Vec.cpp reference in the SOURCES line and remove it.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Converting the Class-Methods to method-templates\nWe now have a class template, but our methods are still class methods. Our next step is to convert each class method into a template method. Test-driven development gives us a systematic, method-by-method means of doing this conversion, without getting overwhelmed by a zillion compiler errors.\nYou should see the message indicating there are no tests if you comment out all of the Vec prototypes, and all of the method definitions you just pasted into the header file. If you want to, and compile (make tester) and run your project(./tester). Just remember that your code was drastically changed, and might not function anymore if you don’t comment certain parts. You should see the message indicating there are no tests.\nOur test-driven procedure will be to: (don’t do this yet – just read the steps below)\n\nIn tests.cpp, uncomment the TEST_CASE. Convert all uses of Vec to be Vec&lt;sometype&gt;. You may choose what type to put in between the &lt; and &gt;, but the type should be an integer type – int, unsigned, short, char, unsigned char, long, etc.\nIn Vec.h, uncomment the corresponding method (i.e., its prototype within the class and its definition outside the class.)\nConvert the method’s definition into a method-template.\nCompile and run the tester.\nIf any errors are reported, find and fix them;\nOtherwise, return to step 1.\n\nConverting a method definition (step 3) to a method-template is fairly simple:\n\nPlace template &lt;class Item&gt; before the beginning of the method’s definition.\nIn the method definition, find each place where the name of the class (e.g., Vec) is being used as a type – each use except when it is being used as the name of an operation like the name of a constructor or destructor – and replace it with the parameterized name of the template (e.g., Vec&lt;Item&gt;).\n\nSo the rest of Part I is to use these steps to convert each of the Vec methods to method-templates.\nTo illustrate this conversion process, let’s run through these steps using some of the Vec constructors.\n\nStep 3a. The Default Constructor.\nIn tests.cpp, uncomment the test that tests the default constructor and convert it to use Vec&lt;sometype&gt;. (Make sure to uncomment the matching curly brackets (}) at the end of the test case section.) Then switch to Vec.h and find the definition of the default constructor. We can perform step 1 by placing template&lt;class Item&gt; before the constructor definition:\ntemplate&lt;class Item&gt;\nVec::Vec() {\n  ...\n}\nThat completes step 1.\nFor step 2, we replace each use of the name of the class (Vec) that is not the name of an operation with the name of the template (Vec&lt;Item&gt;), as follows:\ntemplate&lt;class Item&gt;\nVec&lt;Item&gt;::Vec() {\n  ...\n}\nThat’s it! Save all changes, and compile and run your tests. If you find errors, find and fix them before continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nYou may need to make some additional changes before things build. More than likely, compilation of the tester will not succeed until you have converted several other methods that are used in the default constructor tests, including the destructor.\n\n\nCongratulations! You have just converted your first class-method into a method-template!\n\n\nStep 3b. The Explicit-Value Constructor.\nUsing what we just did to the default constructor as a model, uncomment the explicit constructor’s test, fix the types, then convert the explicit constructor into a method-template. Compile and run your project. If errors occur, fix them. When it passes all tests continue.\nNote that within this constructor, the allocation of the dynamic array uses Item. Previously, this Item was determined by the typedef declaration; but now, Item refers to the name of our template’s parameter. If the user declares:\nVec&lt;double&gt; v1;\nVec&lt;int&gt; v2;\nthen in v1, all of the occurrences of Item will be replaced by double, while in v2, all the occurrences of Item will be replaced by int.\nCongratulations! You’ve just done another method-to-method-template conversion!\n\n\nStep 3c. The Copy Constructor.\nUncomment and fix the copy constructor’s test. In Vec.h, find the copy constructor’s definition. As before, we place template&lt;class Item&gt; before the definition, and replace each occurrence of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation with the name of the template:\ntemplate&lt;class Item&gt;\nVec&lt;Item&gt;::Vec(const Vec&lt;Item&gt;& original) {\n  ...\n}\nNote that the type of any Vec parameter or local variable must be replaced by Vec&lt;Item&gt;. This is consistent with our “conversion rule” – any use of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation (i.e., a constructor or destructor) must be replaced.\nCompile and run your project. Continue when it passes all tests.\n\n\nStep 3d. The Destructor.\nIf you have not already done so, convert the destructor to a method-template. Continue when your conversion passes all tests.\n\n\nStep 3e. The Remaining Operations.\nNow that you know how to do the conversion, we can speed up this mechanical process a bit.\nAt the destructor definition, comment out the line template&lt;class Item&gt;. Then copy the line //template&lt;class Item&gt;. With the remaining operations still commented out, use Ctrl-v to paste that line at the beginning of each of the remaining operations in the header file.\nReturn to the destructor’s definition and uncomment the line template&lt;class Item&gt; in the destructor. Then copy the “phrase” . With the remaining operations still commented out, paste this after each use of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation, throughout the rest of the header file.\nThen, one untested method at a time:\n\nUncomment the converted method.\nUncomment its corresponding test.\nUncomment the call to that test.\nCompile and run the test. When it passes the test, continue to the next untested method.\n\nBy using this methodical approach (Ha, ha! Get it?!?), any compilation errors that occur should be confined to the newly uncommented method-template. This will make it easier and faster for you to find and fix the errors.\nUse this approach to complete the conversion of class Vec to the template Vec&lt;Item&gt;.\nCongratulations! You have just built your first class template!\n\n\n\nDiscussion - Part I\nAs you can see, the C++ syntax to build class templates is a bit complicated, and it is quite easy to make syntax errors if you try to build a template container from the outset. For this reason, we recommend this 2-step approach to building containers:\n\nUse the typedef-Item mechanism to build a container class and thoroughly test its operations.\nConvert the Item container class into a template that receives its type via a parameter.\n\nBy doing so, you can build and test the container in step 1, and debug the logic of its operations. Then (as we have seen today), converting it to a template in step 2 is a mechanical process.\nBecause any type can be passed via the template’s parameter, a container built as a template can store any kind of value. Because they are defined to store “generic” items, container templates are often called generic containers. The template is the C++ mechanism for building generic containers; other languages (e.g., Ada, Java) provide other (simpler) mechanisms."

If it doesn’t, should we make this a const function?Algorithm: - If the index is &gt;= n, throw a range_error exception. - If the index is &lt; -n, throw a range_error exception. Convert the index to be between 0 and n-1 if necessary. Return the index back.\n\n\n\nFinally, implement a find() method as described below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nParameters\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nfind()\nan Item to search for\nIf the item is found in the array, return the index. Otherwise, return -1.\n\n\n\nFirst, add a SECTION(\"find\") to the “PyLists” TEST_CASE in tests.cpp to test the find command. You’ll want to make sure you try to find items that are in a PyList and items that are not in the list. You should also make sure that if an Item is in a list more than one time, the index of the first item is returned.\nAfter you are satisfied with your tests, and you prove that your tests fail, then implement the find() method.\nAfter you do this and have all your tests passing, then Uncomment all the Vec tests in tests.cpp, so that ALL tests are now available, both for Vec and for PyList. Then, of course, recompile and run ./tester to make sure it tests both Vec and PyList."

    "section": "Part 1: A Student Class",
    "text": "Part 1: A Student Class\n\nStep 1. Create the class\nWe will create a class to represent a Student. You probably have not created a class in C++ before, so here are the Pair.h and Pair.cpp classes I created as an example in class. Use this code as an example/template.\nThe instance variables for a Student will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance Variable Name\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault value\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmyName\n\n\nstring\n\n\n“”\n\n\nImmutable (NOTE: this is not a const in our class, but we will not be making setter functions for these immutable values.)\n\n\n\n\nmyId\n\n\nunsigned int\n\n\n0\n\n\nImmutable (NOTE: this is not a const in our class, but we will not be making setter functions for these immutable values.)\n\n\n\n\nmyGpa\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmyMajor\n\n\nstring\n\n\n“Undecided”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Student.h, you should see the definition of the Student class. In that class, create the private: section, and in there define the 4 instance variables, shown in the table above. You’ll have to #include &lt;string&gt; and do the using namespace business…\nCompile (type: make tester) and fix any errors. (You may see warnings – you can ignore those for now.)\nIn Student.h define the default constructor (in the public: section). In Student.cpp, create the default constructor implementation, initializing the instance variables to their default values, as shown in the table above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile and fix any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Create getters\nIn your tests.cpp, you’ll find the first SECTION of unit tests called “student getters”, within the TEST_CASE “Student class”. Uncomment the first SECTION, so that the code to construct a Student object and then test getMajor() runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile\n\n\n\nThe compilation should fail because we haven’t defined getMajor() yet. There should be no other problems.\n\n\nSo, create a getter function (in both the Student.h and Student.cpp files) called getMajor().\nCompile and run (in a terminal, run ./tester \"Student class\") – this should work now.\nNow, repeat the above steps for the other tests and instance variables (maybe make this part more clear in the future). Start with a test in tests.cpp first, then implement the prototype and code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\n\nDon’t delete any old tests – just keep adding more. Put each test in its own SECTION within the “Student class” TEST_CASE.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Create setters\nFor the instance variables that are mutable (see the table above), create setter methods. But first, for each, create a test. Put all of these tests in a new SECTION within the “Student class” TEST_CASE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExample: for the setGpa test, set the student’s gpa to 3.25, then in a REQUIRE statement, call getGpa() and make sure the value is 3.25.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Create an explicit-value constructor\nNow, create a second constructor – the explicit-value constructor. This constructor should take the two immutable fields as parameters, and store their values in the instance variables. Initialize all the other variables to their default values. BUT FIRST, create tests. I called my SECTION “student explicit-value constructor”, and in it I create a Student with the explicit-value constructor and then use the getters on all instance variables to make sure the object has the correct values in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile and test the result. Fix any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are now done with this simple class. We could add tons of other functionality to it, but not now…\nBefore you go on, Commit and Sync your changes to your github repo. You can easily do this from VSCode. After you do this, you should be able to see that the automated tests fail – but the one test that tests the “Student class” passes. If it does not pass, fix your code (or your tests), and resubmit until it does pass."

Do not remove Students.cpp.\n\n\nIn tests.cpp, below all your tests for the Student class, add the tests shown below:\nTEST_CASE(\"Fraction class\") {\n    SECTION(\"fraction constructors\") {\n        SECTION(\"default\") {\n            Fraction fr;\n            REQUIRE(fr.getNumerator() == 0);\n            REQUIRE(fr.getDenominator() == 1);\n        }\n        SECTION(\"explicit value\") {\n            Fraction fr(2, 4);\n            REQUIRE(fr.getNumerator() == 2);\n            REQUIRE(fr.getDenominator() == 4);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou’ll have to #include \"Fraction.h\" at the top of the file.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Add the instance variables and constructors\nAdd the two instance variables – myNumerator and myDenominator (both integers) – to the class definition in the .h file.\nUpdate the default constructor, to initialize myNumerator to 0 and myDenominator to 1.\nNow, implement the explicit-value constructor, which takes both the numerator and denominator as parameters, and stores them in myNumerator and myDenominator. Don’t forget to put the declaration in the .h file and implementation in the .cpp file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will compile our tester after the next section.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. getters\nAdd a new SECTION (within the “Fraction class” TEST_CASE) called “fraction getters” and SECTIONs to call the getter functions and test their results. Compilation should fail, as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYes, this is repetitive as we already used them for the default constructors. Just to make sure we cover all our bases, and this can easily be seen in our tests, make another SECTION to quickly check the getter functions again.\n\n\nNow, create getter functions for each.\nNow the compilation and execution should succeed with all tests passing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can run only some tests by putting the name of the test on the command line. E.g., you can run only the Fraction tests by running:\n./tester \"Fraction class\"\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. setters\nCreate tests to test setters.\nThen, create the methods and the code so it will compile and run successfully.\n\n\nStep 5. Fanciness\nNow, in setDenominator(), check if the parameter is 0 – an illegal value. If so, throw an invalid_argument exception (remember to #include &lt;stdexcept&gt; first). You can do this by using the line:\nthrow invalid_argument(\"Your error message here!\"); // (Change the error message please!)\nHere is a test for that, assuming you have a fraction called f1:\nSECTION(\"setDenominator\") {\n    REQUIRE_THROWS_AS(f1.setDenominator(0), invalid_argument);\n}\n\n\nStep 6. Display as a string\nCreate a test to call asString() on a Fraction object: If you create a new Fraction object newFrac and call newFrac.asString(), you can REQUIRE that the result should be “0/1”. Initially, this test will fail, so create the method, which returns a string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn asString() you can use to_string(anInt) to convert an integer into a string. And, you can concatenate strings with +. to_string() is defined in &lt;string&gt; so you’ll have to #include that.\n\n\nWhen that works, use the setters to change the numerator and denominator for a fraction, and then write a test to ensure that asString() still produces the correct results."

    "section": "Step 3. Using the Debugger",
    "text": "Step 3. Using the Debugger\nA debugger is a program that allows you to set breakpoints in your code, and then run your code. When a breakpoint is encountered, the debugger stops, and allows you to view variables’ values, the call stack, etc.\nThis video shows you how to use the debugger with VS Code. You probably won’t be able to watch this video on a lab machine, but if you have a laptop and/or phone and have earbuds or headphones, you should watch the video. Then, go down to Step 3.5 below.\nIf you cannot watch the video, I’ll describe how to use the debugger here:\nOpen your file that you want to debug. E.g., your functions.cpp file. Here is mine:\n\nYou can see that I have a good start on the function, but it isn’t complete. But, I want to make sure I’m passing in my parameters correctly, and a good way to do that is to use the debugger.\nThe first thing I have to do is build the project:\nmake tester\nIf you look at tests.cpp, you can see a bunch of calls to findDuplicate(), from line 10, line 21, etc.\nTo check if our parameters are being passed in correctly, let’s set a breakpoint on line 2. To do that, put your pointer to the left of the 2 on line 2, and click. You should see a red dot.\n\nYou can set multiple breakpoints at the same time. You could, for example, set a breakpoint on line 3 and line 5, so that you can see in what circumstances your code returns true or false.\nNow, we can start the debugger. The easiest way is to hit F5. Or you can go to Run -&gt; Start Debugging.\n(If you get a weird error, just go on here. You might be trying to debug the wrong executable.)\nWhen you start debugging (successfully), your screen changes quite a bit.\nYou’ll see a menu bar appear at the top of the screen. You’ll also see the debugging icon on the left side become bright:\n\nYou’ll see a debugging window on the left side. And, you’ll see your code run and the debugger will stop at the first breakpoint:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you saw an error when you started debugging, you might be trying to debug the wrong executable. Look at the image just above. Notice that next to the green arrow is a small menu, with a dropdown arrow. You might be trying to debug the “lab2” program instead of the tester program. If you don’t see “tester”, click on the dropdown arrow and choose “Launch tester”, then click the green right-arrow and try again.\n\n\nYou know where your code has stopped because you see the yellow “arrow” overlaying the red dot. This means your code has run to this point and is stopped.\nOn the lower-left corner you see the call stack. The top frame in the call stack is findDuplicate(). Below that you see that findDuplicate() was called from C_A_T_C_H_T_E_S_T_0() in tests.cpp at line 10. Click on that to see tests.cpp and where it called findDuplicate().\n\nNow, to continue from the breakpoint, we can use the menu bar at the top. If you hover your mouse over the items in the menu bar, you’ll see: Continue (F5), Step Over (F10), Step Into (F11), Step Out (Shift F11), and Stop (Shift-F5). Step Over really means “go to the next line”.\n\nClick on Step Over now. You should see your pointer go to line 3, which returns false. Step Over a few more times, and you’ll get back to tests.cpp, line 11. Now, click Continue. That will make the debugger run the code again until it encounters the next breakpoint – which is back at line 2 of functions.cpp. You can again inspect the parameter values.\nClick Continue again. Notice that you are still at line 2, but look closely to see where findDuplicates() was called from. Which line of tests.cpp called findDuplicates()?\nClick on C_A_T_C_H_T_E_S_T_6() on the lower-left corner of the screen, and look at the values of the Local variables in the upper-right corner. What values are in the numbers array?\nThis really concludes our introduction to using the debugger."

Prof. Araújo has been working on that and is comming up with a solution “soon”.\nI haven’t tested running the debugger on Windows. If you want to try that, you will probably have to change the .vscode/launch.json file.

In Vec.cpp, complete the default constructor for the class, so that it sets mySize to zero, and sets myArray to nullptr. Compile and run the project (make tester && ./tester).\nThe test should pass, but notice that it isn’t actually doing anything… To make a useful test, we need to see if mySize is 0 and myArray is nullptr. However, myArray and mySize are private, so the test cannot “reach into” the innards of the Vec object to check the values. To resolve this, we will create a getter for mySize. In the .h file, in the public: section, add the prototypes:\nunsigned getSize() const;\nIn the Vec.cpp file, add this code:\nunsigned Vec::getSize() const {\n}\nand finish the code which returns mySize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that we are NOT going to add a getter method for myArray, which would allow a user of the Vec class to get the address where the values are being stored. We do not want to expose this internal detail to the user, as the user could abuse it and start putting values directly into memory. So, because we won’t make a getter for myArray, we won’t be able to make tests to check the value of myArray.\n\n\nUncomment the lines in the first (“default”) SECTION and compile and run (make tester && ./tester).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you go the next step!\n\n\n\nWhen your definition passes the test, continue; otherwise fix and retest your constructor."

To store the value the user specifies, our constructor will need a parameter, so we might start by writing this stub for the constructor:\nVec::Vec(unsigned size) {\n}\nPut the above code in your .cpp file, and add a prototype for this constructor to the Vec class in Vec.h. Then in tests.cpp, uncomment the first 2 lines of code in the “explicit-value” SECTION that tests this constructor. Save/compile/run the tests. The test should fail.

The Copy Constructor\nThe compiler invokes a special copy constructor any time it needs a copy of an object, for example:\n\nWhen a function returns an object; OR\nWhen an object is passed as an argument to a call-by-value parameter.\n\nThe C++ compiler supplies a default copy constructor, but it merely does a bit-by-bit copy of the instance variables of the object being copied. This bit-copy is inadequate for classes with pointer instance variables, because it just copies the address within such variables, rather than making a distinct copy of the dynamically allocated memory to which that address points. Because of this, every class that contains a pointer instance variable should define its own copy constructor that makes a distinct copy of the object, including its dynamically allocated memory.\nThe stub for a Vec copy constructor looks like this:\nVec::Vec(const Vec& original) {\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf we were to mistakenly make the copy constructor’s parameter a call-by-value parameter instead of a call-by-const-reference parameter, an infinite recursion will occur when the copy constructor is invoked. The reason is that passing a Vec to a call-by-value parameter will invoke the copy constructor, which will take the thing to be copied as a parameter, which will invoke the copy constructor, which will take the thing to be copied as a parameter, which will invoke the copy constructor, which… To avoid this, the parameter of a copy constructor should always be a const-reference parameter, as shown above.\n\n\nAdd the code above to the .cpp file. Then, add a prototype to the Vec class, and in tests.cpp uncomment the code in the “copy” constructor SECTION to test it. Then add statements to your stub to construct a Vec that is a distinct copy of original, and check to see if the tests pass. Here is the algorithm to follow:\n\nSet mySize to the size of original\nIf original.mySize is greater than zero:\n\nDynamically allocate an array of mySize values of type Item, and store the address of the array in myArray.\nSet each itemi in the new array to itemi from original.\n\nOtherwise, set myArray to nullptr.\n\nContinue when your constructor passes all tests.

For example, if we insert items in a “carefully chosen random” order: 44, 66, 22, 55, 11, 77, 33, then our tree will be balanced:\n\nA tree’s shape can be characterized in different ways. One way is by comparing its height, diameter, and maximum width:\n\nA tree’s height is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root node to any of the leaf nodes.\nA tree’s diameter is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaves in the tree. This path often includes the root node, but not necessarily.\nA tree’s maximum width is the largest number of nodes on any given level of the tree.\n\nThe preceding tree’s height is 3, its diameter is 5, and its maximum width is 4. If a binary search tree is balanced, then its height should be about \\(log_2(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of items in the tree.\nBy contrast, if we insert items in ascending order: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, then our tree will be imbalanced one way:\n\nThis tree’s height is 7, its diameter is 7, and its maximum width is 1.\nLikewise, if we insert the items in descending order : 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, then our tree will be imbalanced the other way:\n\nAs before, this tree’s height is 7, its diameter is 7, and its maximum width is 1.\nIn tests.cpp, uncomment the TEST_CASE for “insert()”. Save/compile, and verify that you get a compilation error indicating that insert() is undeclared.\nAdd a prototype of insert() to our BST class; then recompile and verify that only a linking error remains.\nIn BST.h, below the class declaration, create a stub for BST::insert() (a “stub” is code that does nothing – it just returns). Recompile, and when all errors have been eliminated, run the test. Then define BST::insert() so that it passes the test.

    "text": "Three Traversal Methods\nTo traverse a data structure is to pass through each of its items, processing each item in turn. For example, outputting the values in an array, vector, or list usually involves traversing the structure and outputting each item in turn.\nWhen it comes to binary search trees, there are a variety of ways to traverse a BST:\n\nA preorder traversal “processes” the item in a node before the items in the left and right subtrees are (recursively) processed.\nA postorder traversal “processes” the item in a node after the items in the left and right subtrees are (recursively) processed.\nAn inorder traversal “processes” the item in a node after the items in the left subtree have been processed, but before the items in the right subtree have been (recursively) processed.\n\nTo illustrate, the BST class template contains a traversePreorder() method, defined as follows:\nvoid BST::traversePreorder(ostream &out) const {\n    if (!isEmpty()) {\n    myRoot-&gt;traversePreorder(ostream &out);\n    }\n  }\nIf the BST is not empty, this method “passes the buck” by sending the traversePreorder() message to the node whose address is in myRoot. The Node struct defines that (recursive) method as follows:\nvoid BST::Node::traversePreorder(ostream &out) const {\n    // 1. process myItem first (preorder)\n    processItem(out);\n    // 2. then recursively process the items in the left subtree\n    if (myLeft != nullptr) {\n        myLeft-&gt;traversePreorder(out);\n    }\n    // 3. then recursively process the items in the right subtree\n    if (myRight != nullptr) {\n        myRight-&gt;traversePreorder(out);\n    }\n  }\nThe processItem() method can be defined to do any kind of processing of a node’s item. To illustrate, our Node struct defines processItem() to insert a space and then myItem into cout:\nvoid BST::Node::processItem(ostream &out) {\n    out &lt;&lt; myItem &lt;&lt; ' ';\n  }\nNote that all of these functions take an ostream as a parameter and pass it on in their method calls. The processItem() method writes its output to the ostream. By passing in an output stream this way, the caller can have processItem write to standard out (cout) or a file (fout) or even a string, which is what test.cpp does.\nUncomment the TEST_CASE for traversal, and take a moment to look over its tests. Your final task is to define traversePostorder() and traverseInorder() methods that will produce the output expected by the test-method. Use the provided traversePreorder() methods as a model; the other two sets of traversal methods are quite similar.\nWhen your code passes all the tests, congratulations! You now have a basic binary search tree class!"

Then when the user enters a choice, we can validate their choice by checking whether or not their choice is an element of that set.\nAs you can see, our Menu class contains two instance variables: a string storing the menu, and a set to store those menu choices that are valid:\nstring myValue;             // the menu that is displayed\nset&lt;char&gt; myValidChoices;   // the valid menu choices\nSave/compile your project, and verify that everything compiles without errors.\n\nThe Menu Constructor\nThe Menu constructor currently initializes our myValue member; it must also initialize myValidChoices so that it stores the valid menu choices. To do so, we can use the insert() method:\nsetVariable.insert(value);\nthat inserts a single value into a set.\nIn Menu.cpp, add insert() calls to make myValidChoices represent the set {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘q’}.\n\n\nThe Menu::containsChoice() Method\nTo let a program conveniently check whether or not a given character is a valid menu choice, the Menu class provides a boolean method containsChoice(choice) that returns true if and only if choice is a valid menu choice. Currently, this method is a stub-definition that returns false. Your next task is to revise this stub so that it returns true if and only if choice is in the set myValidChoices.\nWe can accomplish this using the find() method.\nSave/compile your project, and when it is free of compilation errors, run the program. When it is free of errors, go on.\nWhen you run your program, you will need to provide your Bridges UserName and Id on the command line: e.g.,\n./movies CS112StudentUsingBridges 123555666"

    "section": "Part II. The App Class",
    "text": "Part II. The App Class\nThe file App.h contains the declaration of class App. This class uses an STL map to store (movieName, set of actors) pairs:\nmap&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; movies_by_name;   // key is movie name; value is set of actors' names.\nNote that the code actually reads like this:\ndb_type movies_by_name;\nIn order to not have to type map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; too often, I created two typedefs at the top of App.h:\ntypedef map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; db_type;\ntypedef map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt;::iterator db_iter;\nNow, the code can use db_type and db_iter instead of map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; and map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt;::iterator, respectively. So much easier to type!\n\nConstructor\nThe App constructor has been defined for you. It takes a vector of MovieActorWikidata entries as a parameter.\nThe constructor code contains the algorithm you should implement to process these entries, building up entries in the movies_by_name map.\nIf you use the hint I gave in class about how accessing a map with [ ] will either create a new entry or update it if it already exists, then the body of the for loop is one line. Otherwise, the body is about 9 lines, and is very tricky code.\nWrite the code now. This code will be difficult to test until you implement the next step.\n\n\nShow All Movies Option\nImplement code for showAllMovies(), to iterate through all entries in movies_by_name, and print out the movie name and then iterate through all actors for that movie, printing them out. I’ve indented the actor’s name, so the output is more readable.\nYou might find it very useful to make the inner loop a separate function. I called that function showActorsInAMovie(). It takes an iterator “pointing” to an object from the movies_by_name collection, and iterates over the “second” field (a set), printing each actor in the set. If you implement this function, you’ll find you can use it again below.\nWhen you think your code is correct (for this and the previous step), try loading all movies from 1955 and printing them all out. The first movie should be:\nMovie: 5 Against the House\n        Alvy Moore\n        Brian Keith\n        George Cisar\n        Guy Madison\n        Hugh Sanders\n        Jean Willes\n        John Larch\n        John Zaremba\n        Kathryn Crosby\n        Kerwin Mathews\n        Kim Novak\n        Mark Hanna\n        Robert Sampson\n        William Conrad\nThe last movie you should see should look like this:\nMovie: Young at Heart\n        Alan Hale, Jr.\n        Doris Day\n        Dorothy Malone\n        Elisabeth Fraser\n        Ethel Barrymore\n        Frank Ferguson\n        Frank Sinatra\n        Gig Young\n        Lonny Chapman\n        Robert Keith\n\n\nShow All Actors For a Single Movie Option\nComplete the code in the getMovienameAndShowActors() method. If you created a function to show all actors for a given movie, then you are half done already.\n\n\nShow All Movies For an Actor Option\nFinally, implement this option. Create a set of strings (I called my variable movies_by_actor.) And then go through all movies, looking for that actor. When you find him/her, add the movie to the movies_by_actor. Then, when you are done, print out the set.\nHere is a sample output:\nEnter an actor name to show all movies for that actor: Alfred Hitchcock\nRear Window\nThe Trouble with Harry\nTo Catch a Thief"

Data structures like arrays, trees, and graphs teach us that even the most complex systems can be understood and managed when approached with order and clarity.\nGod’s creation reflects His intentional design—everything has a purpose and place, from the smallest atom to the vastness of the universe. Similarly, in our programming, we use data structures to bring order to chaos, enabling efficiency and clarity in solving problems.\nAs we work on today’s lab, let us remember that the discipline and creativity we apply to our work reflect the order and purpose God calls us to embody. Let’s strive to build systems that not only function well but also mirror the excellence and intentionality of our Creator.\nPrayer:\nLord, thank You for the gift of logic and creativity. Help us to approach our work with diligence and clarity, bringing order to our ideas just as You bring order to all creation. May our efforts in this lab glorify You and serve as a reflection of Your wisdom. Amen."

    "text": "Details\nAccept the project assignment and use git clone to get the files.\nThe CongaLine class in CongaLine.h has a List member named myLine, in which it stores the names of the people currently in the dance line. Since a Conga Line needs to have at least two people, the CongaLine constructor has two string parameters to which we can pass two people’s names, and our simulation uses this constructor to create an initial line containing “Ann” and “Bob”.\nAssuming your List template is correct, these files should build (make tester and make proj7) and run correctly as they are. However, some of the lines in the file CongaLine.cpp are “commented out”, including:\n//  if (!myLine.insertAfter(otherPersonsName, yourName)) {\n//      cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n***\" &lt;&lt; otherPersonsName\n//           &lt;&lt; \" is not dancing!\\n\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n//  }\nand\n//  if (!myLine.insertBefore(otherPersonsName, yourName)) {\n//      cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n***\" &lt;&lt; otherPersonsName\n//           &lt;&lt; \" is not dancing!\\n\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n//  }\nand\n//  cout &lt;&lt; \"\\n \" &lt;&lt; myLine &lt;&lt; \"\\n\\n\";\nBefore you can uncomment these lines, you will need to implement the corresponding List operations in List.h. Aside from uncommenting these lines, you should not make any other changes to main.cpp, CongaLine.h, or CongaLine.cpp.\n\nThe insertBefore/After Methods\nThe semantics of the first two operations are as follows:\n\nmyLine.insertAfter(otherPersonsName, yourName); Assuming that otherPersonsName is present in myLine, this operation should insert yourName into myLine immediately after otherPersonsName.\nmyLine.insertBefore(otherPersonsName, yourName); Assuming that otherPersonsName is present in myLine, this operation should insert yourName into myLine immediately before otherPersonsName.\n\nEach operation should work correctly regardless of the position of otherPersonsName within myLine. If otherPersonsName is present within myLine, your operation should return true; otherwise it should return false, so that CongaLine::run() can display an error message.\nTo receive full credit for these operations, you should implement them in a time-efficient manner. In particular, you should avoid approaches that use multiple passes through the List, such as (a) first finding the index of the other person (one pass) and then (b) inserting before/after that index (a second pass). Implement each of these methods using a single pass through the List.\n\n\nThe Output operation\nThe semantics of the third operation are as follows:\nanyOstream &lt;&lt; myLine &lt;&lt; ...\nThis &lt;&lt; operation should insert the items in myLine into the ostream that is its left operand, with each item preceded by an “=” separator-string. (The lines in the = character represent a person’s arms.)\nThis operation should return a reference to its left operand, so that these operators can be chained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis operation should use one of the writeTo() methods you implemented last week.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nYou should use test-driven development to implement these operations. A part of your grade will be based on the thoroughness of your tests. Add your tests to the provided tests.cpp.\nFor the insert operations, I strongly encourage you to “design” your method by drawing a diagram of what you want to have happen to the structure in each case. Once you have a diagram to go by, you are more likely to write code that actually does the right thing. (Trial and error is not a good debugging technique.)\nIf you get to the point where you cannot figure out what is wrong, use the debugger! The debugger is the best way to debug problems with pointers!\nAnd finally, here is a silly video, in case you need some inspiration."

    "section": "Step 1. Introduction",
    "text": "Step 1. Introduction\nThis week’s project adds more functionality to the Vec class we built in the lab. To illustrate, suppose that v1, v2, and v3 are Vec objects containing the following values:\nv1 == {1, 2, 3}\nv2 == {2, 4, 6}\nv3 == {1, 2, 3}\n\n1 - Subscript\nThe subscript operator ([i]) can be implemented such that using subscripting on the left-hand-side of an assignment (i.e., setting a value in the array) and using subscripting on the right-hand-side (i.e., getting a value in the array) both work. Thus, the method will be similar to both setItem(i) and getItem(i).\n\nNormally, the subscript operation on an array does not perform bounds checking on the index value i, but yours should perform bounds checking. More precisely, your subscript operator should throw a range_error if it is passed a “bad” index value.\nThe method should return a reference to the item in the array.\n\nHere is the algorithm:\nItem &operator[](unsigned index)\n    check if index is legal. If not, throw a range_error\n    return myArray[index];\nBecause the method is returning a reference to the item in the array, subscripting works for both sides of an assignment.\n\n\n2 - Const subscript\nIf a Vec object is defined as constant then indexing the array in the Vec must also be constant – i.e., it cannot allow code to change the array. In tests.cpp, see a function called testConstSubscript(). This function takes a const-ref parameter. The subscripting of that Vec parameter will require us to implement the const subscripting method. The code in the method is identical to the code you wrote in the previous step above, but it returns const Item &, and is a const method – i.e., has const on the end of the line. Implement that method now so that all subscripting tests pass.\n\n\n3 - Vector Addition\nThe expression:\nv3 = v1 + v2;\nshould set v3 == {3, 6, 9}, without leaking memory.\nWhen C++ compiles v1 + v2, it looks at the types of the values that surround the +. It sees that v1 is a Vec object, so it actually will call operator+() on the v1 object, passing v2 as the parameter. Thus, the prototype is Vec Vec::operator+(const Vec &rhs) const. v1 is the “this” object that operator+ is being called on. v2 is being passed in as the rhs (right-hand-side) parameter.\nThe implementation is quite simple: make sure the sizes of the two Vecs are the same. If not, throw an error of type invalid_argument. If they are the same, create a new Vec object (of the correct size) and loop, repeated adding the values from myArray[i] and rhs[i] together and putting the result into the new Vec object.\n\n\n4 - Vector Subtraction\nThe expression:\nv3 = v1 - v2;\nshould set v3 == {-1, -2, -3}, without leaking memory.\nTo make life easier for you, tests.cpp contains tests for each of these operations. Use these tests and test-driven development to build your operations. If you get your program to compile, but it fails a test and you cannot figure out what is wrong, use the debugger! If necessary, draw a memory diagram and trace through the execution of the problematic function one statement at a time, until you identify the logic error."

    "text": "Step 2. Application\nCongratulations! You have been named the navigation officer on the starship U.S.S. Boobyprize, whose hyper-spatial engines allow the ship and its crew to explore the universe. Current theories suggest that reality consists of 11 or more dimensions, so you need a program to help you navigate through an N-dimensional space.\nVectors can be used to store positions (and/or directional forces) in a coordinate system. Vectors of length 2 can be used to store 2-dimensional (x, y) information; vectors of length 3 can be used to store 3-dimensional (x, y, z) information; and so on. Your task is to write a program that:\n\nPrompts for and has the user enter the number of dimensions in their space, storing this number in a variable N, which it can then use to define vector objects.\nPrompts for and has the user enter a starting position in that space, and stores that position in a vector object sum.\nUses a loop that:\n\nprompts for and has the user enter a position (relative to their current position), and stores that position in a vector,\nadds that vector to the sum vector.\n\nThis loop should let the user enter an arbitrary number of positions.\nOutputs the starting position plus the final position (i.e., the sum of the positions from the accumulator-vector).\n\nFor example, if the user is in a 3-dimensional system, enters the starting point {0, 0, 0}, and then enters the following four 3-dimensional relative-positions:\n{1, 0, 0}\n{0, 1, 0}\n{0, 0, 1}\n{1, 2, 3}\nthe program should then display the starting position ({0,0,0}) and the sum from the accumulator ({2, 3, 4}), which is the user’s final position within the 3-dimensional system.\nAs another example, if the user is navigating through a 5-dimensional space, enters {1, 0, 1, 0, 1} as the starting point, and enters three 5-dimensional relative-positions:\n{0, 1, 0, 1, 0}\n{2, 2, 2, 2, 2}\n{-3, -3, -3, -3, -3}\nthe program should then display the starting position and the final position ({0, 0, 0, 0, 0}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may (if you wish) have your program display the starship’s new position each time it is updated, rather than just displaying the final position at the end.\n\n\nYour application should have the user enter the vectors in the format expected by your readFrom(istream&) method: numbers separated by whitespace. (It does not have to parse through curly-brace and comma characters.) Likewise, your application can display the starship’s position using the format provided by your writeTo(ostream&) method – numbers separated by spaces.\nTo get you well on your way, your repo contains App.cpp and App.h. These files provide most of what you have to implement to finish this project. Just implement the missing TODO parts.\nNow that you have addition implemented, you’ll need to uncomment the line in App.cpp that reads\nres = res + v;\nYou will have to edit main() in main.cpp` to:\n\ncall the App() constructor, and then\non the resulting object, call run().\n\nCompile the program with make proj4 and execute the program by doing ./proj4."

    "text": "Adding getHeight()\nThe height of a tree with a root node is defined as the height of the node’s taller sub-tree, plus 1. As you can see, this is a recursive definition, which needs a base case. The base case is that if a node has no children, its height is 1.\nLet’s give some examples to clarify:\nIf a tree has no nodes, its height is 0. If a tree has 1 node – the root node – its height is 1.\nIf a tree has a root node and that node has either a left child or a right child, or both, its height is 2. Suppose the tree has a root node and that node has a single right child node. The right child node has height 1. The root node’s height is 1 + (the greater of the height of its left subtree – which is 0 – and the right subtree – which is 1). Thus, the root node’s height is 2.\nImplement getHeight() now. Its implementation is similar to insert() or a traversal algorithm in that it uses recursion. The difference here is that each function returns an integer – the node’s height.\n\nThe Experiment\nThe height of a BST determines the speed of operations like insert() and contains(). If we build a “large” BST of N items (e.g., \\(~2^20\\)), and that tree is balanced, then its height should be the minimal \\(O(lg(N))\\) (e.g., 20).\nThis week’s problem is to conduct a simple experiment to see how “tall” BSTs get, given random values. Our objective is to see how close we come to lg(N) height if we build large trees of N randomly ordered values.\nYour repo contains two directories that each contain ten data files (randomInts01.txt, randomInts02.txt, …, randomInts10.txt), each containing \\(2^20-1 = 1,048,575\\) randomly generated integer values. If these values were ordered in exactly the right way, we could build trees of height 20. (On the other hand, if they were ordered in exactly the wrong way, we could build trees of height 1,048,575!)\nYour task is to write a simple program that prompts the user for the name of an input file, reads each value from that file, and inserts it into a BST. Your program should then display the height of the resulting BST.\nThere are minor details to keep in mind:\n\nThere may be duplicate values within an input file, and inserting a duplicate value into our BST will throw an exception. Your program should count and output the number of duplicate values in a given file by catching and handling this exception.\nThere are two directories – one for Linux/MacOS, and one for Windows.\nThese files were generated in the Maroon lab (whose workstations are 64-bit machines), and so the integers in these files are 64-bit integers. However, the C++ int and unsigned types only store integers in 32 bits; the long type stores integers in 64 bits, so use it to store these 64-bit integers.\n\nSince there are ten input files, you will need to run your program ten times. (Or find a clever way to automate this.) For each file, record the corresponding tree-height in a spreadsheet, and the number of duplicate values that were found. Given all ten heights, use the spreadsheet to calculate the minimum height, the maximum height, the average height, the median height, and the standard deviation of the ten heights. (Your spreadsheet will make each of these computations easy.) Finally, use your spreadsheet to create a bar-chart showing each of the ten heights, as a visualization of your data. Finally\nAnswer the following questions in your spreadsheet, below the chart:\n\nIs \\(lg(N)\\) or \\(N\\) a better approximation for your measured heights? Why?\nHow much variance is there in the height of these trees? Is this surprising? Why or why not?\nHow many duplicate values were there (on average)? Is this surprising? Why or why not?\nThe “big Oh” notation \\(O(f(n))\\) implies that there are constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), such that \\(a \\times f(n) + b\\) describes the reality for which \\(O(f(n))\\) is an approximation. A balanced BST of \\(N\\) items has height \\(O(lg(N))\\). Theoretically, there should be values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\times lg(N) + b\\) describes the actual height of a BST built using random data. Using your experimental results, what is a reasonable value for \\(a\\)?"

Then, REQUIRE that the number of scores being stored is 10 – the maximum the object should store. This test should fail because our code does not check for a full array.\nFix the problem by adding code to make sure you only ever store at most 10 scores. Add the code to addScore(): if the array is full – i.e., myNumScores == 10, just return – do not try to add the new score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not a correct solution, but for the time being, it is good enough.\n\n\nAlso, at this time, implement the method getScore(i). The parameter is an index of the score to return. For example, if the array has the value 42 at index 7 and the code calls getScore(7), the value 42 should be returned. You should write multiple tests to make sure the results you get are correct.\nIf the user passes in an invalid index – i.e., an index that is \\(&gt;= myNumScores\\), throw an invalid_argument exception.

    "section": "Step 4. Keep the scores sorted",
    "text": "Step 4. Keep the scores sorted\nNow, the fun part: when we insert a score into the array, we don’t want to just add it to the “end” of the array. Instead, we want to keep the array sorted from highest score to lowest. So it should be inserted into the array after all the scores that are higher than it and before all scores that are less than or equal to it. In order to do this, we’ll have to shift over any lower scores before inserting the new score into the array.\nFor example, suppose the array looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n95\n\n\n93\n\n\n89\n\n\n87\n\n\n70\n\n\n49\n\n\n22\n\n\n19\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nand myNumScores = 10.\nIf the main code now calls addScore(77), the array should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n95\n\n\n93\n\n\n89\n\n\n87\n\n\n77\n\n\n70\n\n\n49\n\n\n22\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that every number \\(&lt;= 77\\) has been shifted up in the array, and the last number has been “lost”. Even though we have called addScore() 11 times, myNumScores is still 10.\nTo implement this, your code has to first iterate through the array and find the location where the new high score should be inserted – in this case, that location is index 5. Then, your code needs to copy values up in the array – starting at index 8, where the value 19 is in the example. You move the value at index 8 to index 9, then the value at index 7 to index 8, etc. Finally, the code needs to insert the new value into the place it should go.\nTo summarize, the algorithm for addScore(score) is:\n\nfind the location to insert the new score – checking if the result is -1. If so, return;\nshift every other value up;\nadd the new score to the array at the found location.\nincrement the number of scores stored – but only if the array was not full before adding the new value.\n\n(When the array was full, then the lowest high score was “lost”.)\nTo implement this, you must create two private methods in the class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod name\n\n\nparameters\n\n\nreturn type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfindLocationToInsert()\n\n\nint newScore\n\n\nint: the index of where to insert the newScore, or -1 if the score is not a new high score.\n\n\n\n\nshiftUp()\n\n\nint fromIndex\n\n\nvoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the new score is lower than all stored high scores, findLocationToInsert should return -1. Your code in addScore() should handle this situation, as shown in the algorithm above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 1\n\n\n\nAbout findLocationToInsert(): loop from 0 to 9 so that your code can discover if the newScore should go at the end of the array. This will work because we’ve initialized the array to all 0s and we assume all scores are \\(&gt;= 0\\).\n\n\nAdd the prototypes to your .h file and add empty “skeleton” implementations in your .cpp file. Implement the algorithm above in your addScore() method. That implementation should be something like 7 lines of code.\nBefore you implement the code, change your tests in tests.cpp. Your tests will have to assume that when addScore() is called, the value is inserted into the correct place, thus keeping the array sorted. So, some of your tests that assumed a value would always be added at the end will have to be replaced/fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 2\n\n\n\nGetting these tests correct is crucial. I added a comment after most of my calls to addScore() to state what the array should be holding at that point. That helped me keep track of how the code should be behaving and what my tests should test for.\n\n\nNow, implement the two private methods. Both must use for loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 3\n\n\n\nYou might find it really useful to create a function to print out the high scores in the object (check the Pair class example). Then, you can call that function from various places to see what the array really holds.\n\n\nOnce you get things working, take another look at your tests. Do you need to add more tests to cover every situation? If so, add them. You’ll be graded on how good your tests are."
