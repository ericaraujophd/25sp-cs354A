    "title": "Week 02: Library Survey Tables Case Study",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the US, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) measures library activity as part of its annual Public Libraries Survey. The survey collects data from more than 9000 library administrative entities, defined by the survey as agencies that provide library services to a particular locality. Data includes the number of branches, staff, books, hours open per year, etc. To teach the concepts below, we will build three tables containing the data from the survey related to the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018. For doing so, we read from the CSV files downloaded from their website. More especifically, some columns will be selected in the process to reduce the amount of non used attributes.\nWe are running SQL queries in a Jupyter environment.\n\n%%capture\n%load_ext sql\n%sql sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\n%config SqlMagic.style = '_DEPRECATED_DEFAULT'\n\nThis will open our database library.db for us. Don’t bother yourself with the config details. That is a trick to run the SQL queries in this environment.\nNow we turn to our tables. We have to create 3 tables. Let’s start with the table for 2018.\n\n%%sql\n-- Creating the 2018 Public Libraries Survey table\n\n-- We drop an old copy of the table, if it exists.\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS libraries_2018;\n\nCREATE TABLE libraries_2018 (\n    stabr text NOT NULL,\n    fscskey text CONSTRAINT fscskey_2018_pkey PRIMARY KEY,\n    libid text NOT NULL,\n    libname text NOT NULL,\n    address text NOT NULL,\n    city text NOT NULL,\n    zip text NOT NULL,\n    county text NOT NULL,\n    phone text NOT NULL,\n    c_relatn text NOT NULL,\n    c_legbas text NOT NULL,\n    c_admin text NOT NULL,\n    c_fscs text NOT NULL,\n    geocode text NOT NULL,\n    lsabound text NOT NULL,\n    startdate text NOT NULL,\n    enddate text NOT NULL,\n    popu_lsa integer NOT NULL,\n    popu_und integer NOT NULL,\n    centlib integer NOT NULL,\n    branlib integer NOT NULL,\n    bkmob integer NOT NULL,\n    totstaff numeric(8,2) NOT NULL,\n    bkvol integer NOT NULL,\n    ebook integer NOT NULL,\n    audio_ph integer NOT NULL,\n    audio_dl integer NOT NULL,\n    video_ph integer NOT NULL,\n    video_dl integer NOT NULL,\n    ec_lo_ot integer NOT NULL,\n    subscrip integer NOT NULL,\n    hrs_open integer NOT NULL,\n    visits integer NOT NULL,\n    reference integer NOT NULL,\n    regbor integer NOT NULL,\n    totcir integer NOT NULL,\n    kidcircl integer NOT NULL,\n    totpro integer NOT NULL,\n    gpterms integer NOT NULL,\n    pitusr integer NOT NULL,\n    wifisess integer NOT NULL,\n    obereg text NOT NULL,\n    statstru text NOT NULL,\n    statname text NOT NULL,\n    stataddr text NOT NULL,\n    longitude numeric(10,7) NOT NULL,\n    latitude numeric(10,7) NOT NULL\n);\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\nDone.\n\n\n[]\n\n\nThis is an empty table. To fill the table, we need to convert our CSV entries to entitites in our database.\nHere I came up with another trick. I created a subprocess that opens SQLite3 and calls the command to convert a CSV file into a table inside the database.

    "title": "Week 02: Library Survey Tables Case Study",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the US, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) measures library activity as part of its annual Public Libraries Survey. The survey collects data from more than 9000 library administrative entities, defined by the survey as agencies that provide library services to a particular locality. Data includes the number of branches, staff, books, hours open per year, etc. To teach the concepts below, we will build three tables containing the data from the survey related to the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018. For doing so, we read from the CSV files downloaded from their website. More especifically, some columns will be selected in the process to reduce the amount of non used attributes.\nWe are running SQL queries in a Jupyter environment.\n\n%%capture\n%load_ext sql\n%sql sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\n%config SqlMagic.style = '_DEPRECATED_DEFAULT'\n\nThis will open our database library.db for us. Don’t bother yourself with the config details. That is a trick to run the SQL queries in this environment.\nNow we turn to our tables. We have to create 3 tables. Let’s start with the table for 2018.\n\n%%sql\n-- Creating the 2018 Public Libraries Survey table\n\n-- We drop an old copy of the table, if it exists.\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS libraries_2018;\n\nCREATE TABLE libraries_2018 (\n    stabr text NOT NULL,\n    fscskey text CONSTRAINT fscskey_2018_pkey PRIMARY KEY,\n    libid text NOT NULL,\n    libname text NOT NULL,\n    address text NOT NULL,\n    city text NOT NULL,\n    zip text NOT NULL,\n    county text NOT NULL,\n    phone text NOT NULL,\n    c_relatn text NOT NULL,\n    c_legbas text NOT NULL,\n    c_admin text NOT NULL,\n    c_fscs text NOT NULL,\n    geocode text NOT NULL,\n    lsabound text NOT NULL,\n    startdate text NOT NULL,\n    enddate text NOT NULL,\n    popu_lsa integer NOT NULL,\n    popu_und integer NOT NULL,\n    centlib integer NOT NULL,\n    branlib integer NOT NULL,\n    bkmob integer NOT NULL,\n    totstaff numeric(8,2) NOT NULL,\n    bkvol integer NOT NULL,\n    ebook integer NOT NULL,\n    audio_ph integer NOT NULL,\n    audio_dl integer NOT NULL,\n    video_ph integer NOT NULL,\n    video_dl integer NOT NULL,\n    ec_lo_ot integer NOT NULL,\n    subscrip integer NOT NULL,\n    hrs_open integer NOT NULL,\n    visits integer NOT NULL,\n    reference integer NOT NULL,\n    regbor integer NOT NULL,\n    totcir integer NOT NULL,\n    kidcircl integer NOT NULL,\n    totpro integer NOT NULL,\n    gpterms integer NOT NULL,\n    pitusr integer NOT NULL,\n    wifisess integer NOT NULL,\n    obereg text NOT NULL,\n    statstru text NOT NULL,\n    statname text NOT NULL,\n    stataddr text NOT NULL,\n    longitude numeric(10,7) NOT NULL,\n    latitude numeric(10,7) NOT NULL\n);\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\nDone.\n\n\n[]\n\n\nThis is an empty table. To fill the table, we need to convert our CSV entries to entitites in our database.\nHere I came up with another trick. I created a subprocess that opens SQLite3 and calls the command to convert a CSV file into a table inside the database. The code is as follows:\n\nimport subprocess\nimport tempfile\nimport os\n\n# Paths and settings\ncsv_path = \"dbs/w02/pls_fy2018_libraries.csv\"\ndb_path = \"dbs/w02/library.db\"\ntable_name = \"libraries_2018\"\n\n# Step 1: Create a temporary CSV file without the header\nwith open(csv_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as original, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w', delete=False, newline='', encoding='utf-8') as noheader:\n    next(original)  # skip the header\n    for line in original:\n        noheader.write(line)\n    temp_csv_path = noheader.name\n\n# Step 2: Build the SQLite shell command\nsqlite_cmd = f\"\"\"\n.mode csv\n.import '{temp_csv_path}' {table_name}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 3: Run the command with subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"sqlite3\", db_path], input=sqlite_cmd, text=True)\n\n# Step 4: Clean up the temp file\nos.remove(temp_csv_path)\n\nprint(f\"✅ Imported '{csv_path}' into '{table_name}' in '{db_path}' (header skipped)\")\n\n✅ Imported 'dbs/w02/pls_fy2018_libraries.csv' into 'libraries_2018' in 'dbs/w02/library.db' (header skipped)\n\n\n\nLet’s see if the data was loaded?

Those are the 50 states plus Washington D.C. and several U.S. territories. We don’t have to worry about duplicates in this case.\nWe could also have grouped by city and state, using two columns instead of one. Let’s see how would that work.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT city, stabr\nFROM libraries_2018\nGROUP BY city, stabr\nORDER BY city, stabr\nLIMIT 20;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ncity\nstabr\n\n\n\n\nABBEVILLE\nAL\n\n\nABBEVILLE\nLA\n\n\nABBEVILLE\nSC\n\n\nABBOTSFORD\nWI\n\n\nABERDEEN\nID\n\n\nABERDEEN\nSD\n\n\nABERNATHY\nTX\n\n\nABILENE\nKS\n\n\nABILENE\nTX\n\n\nABINGDON\nIL\n\n\nABINGDON\nVA\n\n\nABINGTON\nCT\n\n\nABINGTON\nMA\n\n\nABINGTON\nPA\n\n\nABIQUIU\nNM\n\n\nABSECON\nNJ\n\n\nACCOMAC\nVA\n\n\nACKERMAN\nMS\n\n\nACKLEY\nIA\n\n\nACTON\nMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will limit the number of rows to 10, so we can see the result. The LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of records to return. As you can see, the results are sorted by the first column, which is the city name and then by the state name. The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order. By default, it sorts in ascending order. We could have used the DESC keyword to sort in descending order. I will leave this as an exercise for you.\nBy combinint GROUP BY with an aggregate function, we can get the number of libraries in each state. Let’s see how many libraries are in each state.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT stabr, count(*) as total\nFROM libraries_2018\nGROUP BY stabr\nORDER BY total DESC\nLIMIT 20;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nstabr\ntotal\n\n\n\n\nNY\n756\n\n\nIL\n623\n\n\nTX\n560\n\n\nIA\n544\n\n\nPA\n451\n\n\nMI\n398\n\n\nWI\n381\n\n\nMA\n369\n\n\nKS\n325\n\n\nNJ\n295\n\n\nME\n263\n\n\nOH\n251\n\n\nNE\n245\n\n\nIN\n236\n\n\nNH\n225\n\n\nAL\n224\n\n\nCA\n218\n\n\nCT\n192\n\n\nTN\n186\n\n\nVT\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is returning the values in the stabrcolumn and the count of how many rows have a given stabr value. The COUNT(*) function counts all rows in each group. The GROUP BY clause groups the result set by the stabr column, and the ORDER BY clause sorts the result set by the count of libraries in descending order.\nLibrary agencies can have many branches. Not all of them will provide an outlet for the public to walk in and borrow books. Some of them are just a warehouse for books, or a place to store the books that are not in use. We can see how many branches are in each state by checking the centlib and branlib columns. You can use the SUM() function in this case. This will be left as an exercise for you.\nWe can also use GROUP BY to group by multiple columns. For example, we can verify how many libraries changed their addresses by state. The column stataddr contains a code indicating whether the agency’s address changed or not. The code is as follows:\n\n00 - No change\n07 - Moved to a new address\n15 - Minor address change\n\nThe code below will show how many libraries changed their address by state.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT stabr, stataddr, count(*) as total\nFROM libraries_2018\nGROUP BY stabr, stataddr\nORDER BY stabr, stataddr\nLIMIT 20;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nstabr\nstataddr\ntotal\n\n\n\n\nAK\n00\n82\n\n\nAL\n00\n220\n\n\nAL\n07\n3\n\n\nAL\n15\n1\n\n\nAR\n00\n58\n\n\nAR\n07\n1\n\n\nAR\n15\n1\n\n\nAS\n00\n1\n\n\nAZ\n00\n88\n\n\nAZ\n15\n1\n\n\nCA\n00\n180\n\n\nCA\n07\n2\n\n\nCA\n15\n36\n\n\nCO\n00\n113\n\n\nCT\n00\n190\n\n\nCT\n07\n1\n\n\nCT\n15\n1\n\n\nDC\n00\n1\n\n\nDE\n00\n21\n\n\nFL\n00\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, most libraries did not change their address.\n\n📙 Visits over the years\nWe saw before some negative numbers in the visits column due to the way data was collected. Now we turn to see the trends in library visits over the years. We will use the SUM() function to get the total number of visits for each year. The code below will show how many visits were made in each year. We will discard the negative values for this analysis. The SUM() function will ignore the negative values, so we don’t have to worry about them.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT sum(visits) AS visits_2018\nFROM libraries_2018\nWHERE visits &gt; 0;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisits_2018\n\n\n\n\n1292348697\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT sum(visits) AS visits_2017\nFROM libraries_2017\nWHERE visits &gt; 0;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisits_2017\n\n\n\n\n1319803999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT sum(visits) AS visits_2016\nFROM libraries_2016\nWHERE visits &gt; 0;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisits_2016\n\n\n\n\n1355648987\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went from 1.36 billion visits in 2016 to 1.32 billion in 2017, and then to 1.29 billion in 2018. This is a decrease of about 5% over the three years.\nBut we know that the number of libraries change as they close or open. To have a better idea of the trend, we will only consider libraries present in the three years. We can do this by using the INNER JOIN clause. The code below will show how many visits were made in each year, but only for libraries that were present in all three years.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT sum(pls18.visits) AS visits_2018,\n       sum(pls17.visits) AS visits_2017,\n       sum(pls16.visits) AS visits_2016\nFROM libraries_2018 AS pls18\n    JOIN libraries_2017 AS pls17 ON pls18.fscskey = pls17.fscskey\n    JOIN libraries_2016 AS pls16 ON pls18.fscskey = pls16.fscskey\nWHERE pls18.visits &gt;= 0\n  AND pls17.visits &gt;= 0\n  AND pls16.visits &gt;= 0;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nvisits_2018\nvisits_2017\nvisits_2016\n\n\n\n\n1278148838\n1319325387\n1355078384\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results didn’t change much. We can also take a look at the number of wifi accesses the year in the same way we did for the visitors.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT sum(pls18.wifisess) AS wifisess_2018,\n       sum(pls17.wifisess) AS wifisess_2017,\n       sum(pls16.wifisess) AS wifisess_2016\nFROM libraries_2018 AS pls18\n    JOIN libraries_2017 AS pls17 ON pls18.fscskey = pls17.fscskey\n    JOIN libraries_2016 AS pls16 ON pls18.fscskey = pls16.fscskey\nWHERE pls18.wifisess &gt;= 0\n  AND pls17.wifisess &gt;= 0\n  AND pls16.wifisess &gt;= 0;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nwifisess_2018\nwifisess_2017\nwifisess_2016\n\n\n\n\n349767271\n311336231\n234926102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the number of visitors decreased, the number of wifi accesses increased. This is a clear indication that people are using the library for more than just borrowing books. They are also using it as a place to study and work.\nTo investigate if the decrease in the number of visitors is a trend in all regions, we must group by state. The code below will show how many visits were made in each year, but only for libraries that were present in all three years.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT  pls2018.stabr,\n        sum(pls2018.visits) AS visits_2018,\n        sum(pls2017.visits) AS visits_2017,\n        sum(pls2016.visits) AS visits_2016,\n        round ( ( \n                 (sum(pls2018.visits) - sum(pls2017.visits) ) * 1.0 / sum(pls2017.visits) ) * 100, 1\n               ) AS visits_ratio_2018_2017,\n        round ( ( (sum(pls2017.visits) - sum(pls2016.visits) ) * 1.0 / \n                 sum(pls2016.visits) ) * 100, 1) AS visits_ratio_2017_2016\nFROM libraries_2018 AS pls2018\n    JOIN libraries_2017 AS pls2017 ON pls2018.fscskey = pls2017.fscskey\n    JOIN libraries_2016 AS pls2016 ON pls2018.fscskey = pls2016.fscskey\nWHERE pls2018.visits &gt;= 0\n  AND pls2017.visits &gt;= 0\n  AND pls2016.visits &gt;= 0\nGROUP BY pls2018.stabr\nORDER BY visits_ratio_2018_2017 DESC;\n\n * sqlite:///dbs/w02/library.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nstabr\nvisits_2018\nvisits_2017\nvisits_2016\nvisits_ratio_2018_2017\nvisits_ratio_2017_2016\n\n\n\n\nSD\n3824804\n3699212\n3722376\n3.4\n-0.6\n\n\nMT\n4332900\n4215484\n4298268\n2.8\n-1.9\n\n\nFL\n68423689\n66697122\n70991029\n2.6\n-6.0\n\n\nND\n2216377\n2162189\n2201730\n2.5\n-1.8\n\n\nID\n8179077\n8029503\n8597955\n1.9\n-6.6\n\n\nDC\n3632539\n3593201\n3930763\n1.1\n-8.6\n\n\nUT\n15326963\n15295494\n16096911\n0.2\n-5.0\n\n\nNH\n7045010\n7028800\n7236567\n0.2\n-2.9\n\n\nME\n6746380\n6731768\n6811441\n0.2\n-1.2\n\n\nDE\n4122181\n4117904\n4125899\n0.1\n-0.2\n\n\nOK\n13399265\n13491194\n13112511\n-0.7\n2.9\n\n\nWY\n3338772\n3367413\n3536788\n-0.9\n-4.8\n\n\nMA\n39926583\n40453003\n40427356\n-1.3\n0.1\n\n\nWA\n37338635\n37916034\n38634499\n-1.5\n-1.9\n\n\nMN\n22952388\n23326303\n24033731\n-1.6\n-2.9\n\n\nNM\n6908686\n7036582\n7178428\n-1.8\n-2.0\n\n\nVA\n33913162\n34563079\n35649602\n-1.9\n-3.0\n\n\nKS\n13483333\n13737900\n13699223\n-1.9\n0.3\n\n\nNY\n97921323\n100012193\n103081304\n-2.1\n-3.0\n\n\nWI\n30097183\n30865470\n31442577\n-2.5\n-1.8\n\n\nAL\n14188647\n14583055\n15637164\n-2.7\n-6.7\n\n\nMI\n44758918\n46052561\n46734166\n-2.8\n-1.5\n\n\nCO\n31085356\n31975615\n32011432\n-2.8\n-0.1\n\n\nNJ\n40947978\n42181061\n42429576\n-2.9\n-0.6\n\n\nCA\n146656984\n151056672\n155613529\n-2.9\n-2.9\n\n\nCT\n20423515\n21051597\n21603777\n-3.0\n-2.6\n\n\nRI\n5490076\n5669309\n5778025\n-3.2\n-1.9\n\n\nPA\n40885876\n42243049\n44105513\n-3.2\n-4.2\n\n\nOR\n19592295\n20244499\n20391927\n-3.2\n-0.7\n\n\nIN\n30836051\n31849195\n33363879\n-3.2\n-4.5\n\n\nIA\n16674976\n17245764\n17753953\n-3.3\n-2.9\n\n\nNV\n9334070\n9684935\n9733359\n-3.6\n-0.5\n\n\nNE\n7449868\n7726127\n7873829\n-3.6\n-1.9\n\n\nVT\n3526357\n3673501\n3721332\n-4.0\n-1.3\n\n\nSC\n13989511\n14567585\n15802934\n-4.0\n-7.8\n\n\nAK\n3268073\n3402486\n3467234\n-4.0\n-1.9\n\n\nIL\n63466887\n66166082\n67336230\n-4.1\n-1.7\n\n\nNC\n31263894\n32621293\n33605264\n-4.2\n-2.9\n\n\nMD\n24976429\n26089963\n27481583\n-4.3\n-5.1\n\n\nAZ\n23439707\n24584201\n25315276\n-4.7\n-2.9\n\n\nOH\n68176967\n71895854\n74119719\n-5.2\n-3.0\n\n\nWV\n4944242\n5231251\n5231443\n-5.5\n-0.0\n\n\nMO\n24663467\n26117633\n27065546\n-5.6\n-3.5\n\n\nKY\n16910828\n17909495\n18028488\n-5.6\n-0.7\n\n\nLA\n16227594\n17211007\n20262385\n-5.7\n-15.1\n\n\nTX\n66168387\n70514138\n70975901\n-6.2\n-0.7\n\n\nTN\n18102460\n19396554\n18701973\n-6.7\n3.7\n\n\nGA\n26835701\n28816233\n27987249\n-6.9\n3.0\n\n\nAR\n9551686\n10358181\n10596035\n-7.8\n-2.2\n\n\nGU\n75119\n81572\n71813\n-7.9\n13.6\n\n\nMS\n7602710\n8581994\n8915406\n-11.4\n-3.7\n\n\nHI\n3456131\n4135229\n4490320\n-16.4\n-7.9\n\n\nAS\n48828\n67848\n63166\n-28.0\n7.4"

    "text": "🧮 1. SQL Aggregation & Grouping (with SQLite Notes)\nSQL lets you summarize data using aggregate functions, and group it with GROUP BY. This is especially helpful for statistics, reports, and dashboards.\n\n🎯 Common Aggregate Functions\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT()\nNumber of rows\nCOUNT(*)\n\n\nSUM()\nTotal of values\nSUM(amount)\n\n\nAVG()\nMean average\nAVG(score)\n\n\nMIN()\nSmallest value\nMIN(age)\n\n\nMAX()\nLargest value\nMAX(salary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n✅ SQLite supports all these functions.\n\n\n\n\n🧩 Basic Grouping Example\nQ: How many students are in each major?\nSELECT major, COUNT(*) AS student_count\nFROM students\nGROUP BY major;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n✅ SQLite allows this even if you’re selecting columns not in the GROUP BY clause or not inside an aggregate function. It will return one arbitrary value from each group for such columns.\n\n\nExample (SQLite accepts this):\nSELECT major, name\nFROM students\nGROUP BY major;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis works in SQLite — it will return one name for each major, but which name is returned is undefined. ❌ PostgreSQL (and other standards-compliant SQL engines) will reject this query with an error unless name is also in the GROUP BY or wrapped in an aggregate like MIN(name).\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Filtering Groups with HAVING\nUse HAVING to filter after grouping.\nQ: Show only majors with more than 10 students:\nSELECT major, COUNT(*) AS student_count\nFROM students\nGROUP BY major\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nℹ️ In SQLite, you can refer to the alias (student_count) in HAVING. In PostgreSQL, you’d need to repeat the expression: HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10.\n\n\n\n\n📊 Combining Aggregates\nQ: Show average GPA per department — only if it’s above 3.5:\nSELECT department, AVG(gpa) AS avg_gpa\nFROM students\nGROUP BY department\nHAVING AVG(gpa) &gt; 3.5;\n\n\n🔗 Grouping by Expressions\nYou can group by computed values like substrings or date parts.\nQ: Count students by admission year (from text-based dates):\nSELECT SUBSTR(admission_date, 1, 4) AS year, COUNT(*) AS num_students\nFROM students\nGROUP BY year;\nThe SUBSTR() function extracts a substring from a given string.\nSUBSTR(string, start, length)\n\nstring: the text to extract from\nstart: the position to start (1-based index)\nlength (optional): how many characters to return\n\n-- Get the first 4 characters of a date\nSELECT SUBSTR('2024-09-15', 1, 4);  -- Returns '2024'\n\n-- Get the first letter of a name\nSELECT SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) FROM students;\n📌 If length is omitted, SQLite returns the rest of the string from start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n✅ Works well in SQLite (which stores dates as text: YYYY-MM-DD). ❗ In PostgreSQL, use: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM admission_date).\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Tips for Grouping Queries\n\nUse GROUP BY with aggregate functions.\nUse HAVING to filter groups (not rows).\nUse WHERE for filtering before grouping.\nPrefer column names or expressions in GROUP BY, not just positions (e.g., avoid GROUP BY 1).\nBe cautious using non-aggregated, non-grouped columns in SQLite — it’s allowed, but not portable or predictable."

    "section": "🔧 Key Techniques & Examples",
    "text": "🔧 Key Techniques & Examples\n\n1. Use SELECT Only What You Need\nAvoid SELECT * — only select necessary columns.\n-- Bad\nSELECT * FROM orders;\n\n-- Good\nSELECT order_id, order_date FROM orders;\n🔍 In other DBMSs, SELECT * can even prevent index-only scans (e.g., PostgreSQL). In DBMSs like PostgreSQL, an index-only scan is a powerful optimization. It allows the database to read data directly from the index without having to access the full table (also called the heap). This is much faster, especially on large tables.\nBut for this to work, two things must be true:\n\nAll the required columns must be in the index\nThere must be no need to access the actual table rows\n\nSQLite does not support index-only scans in the same way PostgreSQL does. So in SQLite, this specific optimization doesn’t apply — but it’s still a good habit to avoid SELECT * for performance and clarity.\n\n\n2. Filter Early with WHERE\nApply WHERE clauses to reduce the number of rows processed.\n-- Bad\nSELECT customer_id FROM orders;\n\n-- Good\nSELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_date &gt; '2024-01-01';\nIn SQLite, filtering helps avoid unnecessary disk reads since it uses B-Trees for indexes.\n\n\n3. Use Indexes Wisely\nIndexes speed up WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY. But avoid over-indexing!\n-- Create index on order_date for filtering\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_order_date ON orders(order_date);\nIn PostgreSQL, you can use EXPLAIN to see if indexes are used. In SQLite, use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN.\nAn index is like a sorted list that a database uses to quickly find data in a table — similar to an index in a book.\nInstead of scanning every row (called a full table scan), the database looks in the index to jump directly to the relevant rows, which is much faster.\n📌 Key Points about Indexes\n\nSpeeds up WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY queries.\nUses extra disk space.\nToo many indexes = slower inserts/updates (because all indexes need updating).\nBest used on columns frequently used in filtering or joining.\n\n\n\n4. Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns\nUsing functions on columns disables index use.\n-- Bad (no index use)\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE strftime('%Y', order_date) = '2024';\n\n-- Good\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date &gt;= '2024-01-01' AND order_date &lt; '2025-01-01';\n\n\n5. Use EXISTS Instead of IN for Subqueries\n-- Slower for large subqueries\nSELECT name FROM customers \nWHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);\n\n-- Faster with EXISTS\nSELECT name FROM customers c\nWHERE EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id\n);\nThis query retrieves the names of customers who have at least one order.\nIn SQLite, both are often converted internally, but EXISTS is still preferable with correlated subqueries.\nThe subquery\nSELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id\nsays: “Is there at least one order where orders.customer_id = this customer’s ID?”. If yes, the customer is included in the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSELECT 1 just returns a dummy value — it could be SELECT * or SELECT 'x'; it doesn’t matter because EXISTS only cares about the existence of at least one matching row.\n\n\nThis is often faster than:\nSELECT name FROM customers\nWHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);\nBecause EXISTS can stop searching early (as soon as it finds a match), while IN may need to collect all values first, depending on the DBMS.\n\n\n6. Use JOINs Instead of Subqueries (when appropriate)\n-- Subquery\nSELECT name FROM customers \nWHERE customer_id IN (\n  SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE total &gt; 100\n);\n\n-- JOIN (may perform better)\nSELECT DISTINCT c.name \nFROM customers c\n    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nWHERE o.total &gt; 100;\nIn MySQL and PostgreSQL, query planners can optimize JOINs more effectively.\n\n\n7. Limit Result Set with LIMIT\nAlways add a LIMIT for preview or pagination.\nSELECT * FROM logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;"

Use ANALYZE to collect statistics and help the query planner:\nANALYZE;\nANALYZE is a command that collects statistics about the contents of tables and indexes.

Whoever you are, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. God delights in diversity and I do, too. We humans need diverse viewpoints because every viewpoint, on its own, has blind spots. That has been proven to be true in technology-related fields, where under-represented minorities are significantly under-represented in the working world. When companies work hard to rectify this, they find their products and services improve. We have found this to be true in Computer Science classrooms as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n\n\nIf you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to know about it so that we can work toward a remedy. This has happened in the past in my classroom – usually when I’m trying to be “cool” or be funny. If this happens this semester, please know that it was unintentional. Because this kind of feedback can be uncomfortable for all involved, I’ll take it however it comes: in public or in private, on the spot or days later, directly from you or indirectly through another student, another professor, or through my department chair Keith VanderLinden (kvlinden@calvin.edu)."

    "text": "🔐 Topics for Database Security\n🔒 1. SQL Injection • What it is: Attacks where malicious SQL is injected into a query. • Why it matters: It’s one of the most common web security vulnerabilities. • Key concepts: • Use of parameterized queries / prepared statements • Risks of string concatenation • Demo: Show how unsafe user input can manipulate a query. • ✅ SQLite supports parameter binding via libraries (like Python’s sqlite3, PHP, etc.)\n⸻\n👤 2. Authentication and Access Control\n(More relevant in full-featured DBMSs, but important conceptually) • What it is: Managing who can access what in a database. • SQLite doesn’t support users or roles, but you can: • Discuss permissions in PostgreSQL/MySQL (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE) • Mention OS-level protections in SQLite (file permissions)\n⸻\n📦 3. Data at Rest Protection • Encryption: • Explain database-level encryption (e.g., SQLCipher for SQLite) • Compare with TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) in SQL Server or Oracle • File system security: • Emphasize securing the .db file from unauthorized users\n⸻\n🔄 4. Backups and Integrity • Importance of: • Secure and consistent backups • Validating data integrity after restore • Tools: sqlite3 .backup command, VACUUM for cleanup\n⸻\n🧾 5. Logging & Auditing • What to track: queries, access, errors • In SQLite: • Logging must be implemented at the application layer • In PostgreSQL: • Native audit/logging tools exist (e.g., pg_stat_activity)\n⸻\n📋 6. Principle of Least Privilege • Always give users the minimum permissions they need • Relate this to: • Access control in PostgreSQL (REVOKE ALL, then GRANT what’s needed) • App-level SQLite access modes (read-only, read-write)\n⸻\n🧪 7. Practical Threat Scenarios • What happens if… • The database file is leaked? • Users can insert raw SQL? • No input validation is done? • Use small case studies or labs to reinforce concepts\n⸻\n⚖️ Optional (Advanced) • Hashing and salting passwords (e.g., for login tables) • Certificate-based connections (in PostgreSQL/MySQL) • Security implications of cloud databases"
