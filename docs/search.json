Whoever you are, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. God delights in diversity and I do, too. We humans need diverse viewpoints because every viewpoint, on its own, has blind spots. That has been proven to be true in technology-related fields, where under-represented minorities are significantly under-represented in the working world. When companies work hard to rectify this, they find their products and services improve. We have found this to be true in Computer Science classrooms as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n\n\nIf you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to know about it so that we can work toward a remedy. This has happened in the past in my classroom – usually when I’m trying to be “cool” or be funny. If this happens this semester, please know that it was unintentional. Because this kind of feedback can be uncomfortable for all involved, I’ll take it however it comes: in public or in private, on the spot or days later, directly from you or indirectly through another student, another professor, or through my department chair Keith VanderLinden (kvlinden@calvin.edu)."

    "section": "Step 4. Keep the scores sorted",
    "text": "Step 4. Keep the scores sorted\nNow, the fun part: when we insert a score into the array, we don’t want to just add it to the “end” of the array. Instead, we want to keep the array sorted from highest score to lowest. So it should be inserted into the array after all the scores that are higher than it and before all scores that are less than or equal to it. In order to do this, we’ll have to shift over any lower scores before inserting the new score into the array.\nFor example, suppose the array looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n95\n\n\n93\n\n\n89\n\n\n87\n\n\n70\n\n\n49\n\n\n22\n\n\n19\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nand myNumScores = 10.\nIf the main code now calls addScore(77), the array should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n95\n\n\n93\n\n\n89\n\n\n87\n\n\n77\n\n\n70\n\n\n49\n\n\n22\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that every number \\(&lt;= 77\\) has been shifted up in the array, and the last number has been “lost”. Even though we have called addScore() 11 times, myNumScores is still 10.\nTo implement this, your code has to first iterate through the array and find the location where the new high score should be inserted – in this case, that location is index 5. Then, your code needs to copy values up in the array – starting at index 8, where the value 19 is in the example. You move the value at index 8 to index 9, then the value at index 7 to index 8, etc. Finally, the code needs to insert the new value into the place it should go.\nTo summarize, the algorithm for addScore(score) is:\n\nfind the location to insert the new score – checking if the result is -1. If so, return;\nshift every other value up;\nadd the new score to the array at the found location.\nincrement the number of scores stored – but only if the array was not full before adding the new value.\n\n(When the array was full, then the lowest high score was “lost”.)\nTo implement this, you must create two private methods in the class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod name\n\n\nparameters\n\n\nreturn type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfindLocationToInsert()\n\n\nint newScore\n\n\nint: the index of where to insert the newScore, or -1 if the score is not a new high score.\n\n\n\n\nshiftUp()\n\n\nint fromIndex\n\n\nvoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the new score is lower than all stored high scores, findLocationToInsert should return -1. Your code in addScore() should handle this situation, as shown in the algorithm above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 1\n\n\n\nAbout findLocationToInsert(): loop from 0 to 9 so that your code can discover if the newScore should go at the end of the array. This will work because we’ve initialized the array to all 0s and we assume all scores are \\(&gt;= 0\\).\n\n\nAdd the prototypes to your .h file and add empty “skeleton” implementations in your .cpp file. Implement the algorithm above in your addScore() method. That implementation should be something like 7 lines of code.\nBefore you implement the code, change your tests in tests.cpp. Your tests will have to assume that when addScore() is called, the value is inserted into the correct place, thus keeping the array sorted. So, some of your tests that assumed a value would always be added at the end will have to be replaced/fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 2\n\n\n\nGetting these tests correct is crucial. I added a comment after most of my calls to addScore() to state what the array should be holding at that point. That helped me keep track of how the code should be behaving and what my tests should test for.\n\n\nNow, implement the two private methods. Both must use for loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 3\n\n\n\nYou might find it really useful to create a function to print out the high scores in the object (check the Pair class example). Then, you can call that function from various places to see what the array really holds.\n\n\nOnce you get things working, take another look at your tests. Do you need to add more tests to cover every situation? If so, add them. You’ll be graded on how good your tests are."

    "text": "Adding getHeight()\nThe height of a tree with a root node is defined as the height of the node’s taller sub-tree, plus 1. As you can see, this is a recursive definition, which needs a base case. The base case is that if a node has no children, its height is 1.\nLet’s give some examples to clarify:\nIf a tree has no nodes, its height is 0. If a tree has 1 node – the root node – its height is 1.\nIf a tree has a root node and that node has either a left child or a right child, or both, its height is 2. Suppose the tree has a root node and that node has a single right child node. The right child node has height 1. The root node’s height is 1 + (the greater of the height of its left subtree – which is 0 – and the right subtree – which is 1). Thus, the root node’s height is 2.\nImplement getHeight() now. Its implementation is similar to insert() or a traversal algorithm in that it uses recursion. The difference here is that each function returns an integer – the node’s height.\n\nThe Experiment\nThe height of a BST determines the speed of operations like insert() and contains(). If we build a “large” BST of N items (e.g., \\(~2^20\\)), and that tree is balanced, then its height should be the minimal \\(O(lg(N))\\) (e.g., 20).\nThis week’s problem is to conduct a simple experiment to see how “tall” BSTs get, given random values. Our objective is to see how close we come to lg(N) height if we build large trees of N randomly ordered values.\nYour repo contains two directories that each contain ten data files (randomInts01.txt, randomInts02.txt, …, randomInts10.txt), each containing \\(2^20-1 = 1,048,575\\) randomly generated integer values. If these values were ordered in exactly the right way, we could build trees of height 20. (On the other hand, if they were ordered in exactly the wrong way, we could build trees of height 1,048,575!)\nYour task is to write a simple program that prompts the user for the name of an input file, reads each value from that file, and inserts it into a BST. Your program should then display the height of the resulting BST.\nThere are minor details to keep in mind:\n\nThere may be duplicate values within an input file, and inserting a duplicate value into our BST will throw an exception. Your program should count and output the number of duplicate values in a given file by catching and handling this exception.\nThere are two directories – one for Linux/MacOS, and one for Windows.\nThese files were generated in the Maroon lab (whose workstations are 64-bit machines), and so the integers in these files are 64-bit integers. However, the C++ int and unsigned types only store integers in 32 bits; the long type stores integers in 64 bits, so use it to store these 64-bit integers.\n\nSince there are ten input files, you will need to run your program ten times. (Or find a clever way to automate this.) For each file, record the corresponding tree-height in a spreadsheet, and the number of duplicate values that were found. Given all ten heights, use the spreadsheet to calculate the minimum height, the maximum height, the average height, the median height, and the standard deviation of the ten heights. (Your spreadsheet will make each of these computations easy.) Finally, use your spreadsheet to create a bar-chart showing each of the ten heights, as a visualization of your data. Finally\nAnswer the following questions in your spreadsheet, below the chart:\n\nIs \\(lg(N)\\) or \\(N\\) a better approximation for your measured heights? Why?\nHow much variance is there in the height of these trees? Is this surprising? Why or why not?\nHow many duplicate values were there (on average)? Is this surprising? Why or why not?\nThe “big Oh” notation \\(O(f(n))\\) implies that there are constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), such that \\(a \\times f(n) + b\\) describes the reality for which \\(O(f(n))\\) is an approximation. A balanced BST of \\(N\\) items has height \\(O(lg(N))\\). Theoretically, there should be values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\times lg(N) + b\\) describes the actual height of a BST built using random data. Using your experimental results, what is a reasonable value for \\(a\\)?"

    "text": "Step 1. Introduction\nThis week’s project adds more functionality to the Vec class we built in the lab. To illustrate, suppose that v1, v2, and v3 are Vec objects containing the following values:\nv1 == {1, 2, 3}\nv2 == {2, 4, 6}\nv3 == {1, 2, 3}\n\n1 - Subscript\nThe subscript operator ([i]) can be implemented such that using subscripting on the left-hand-side of an assignment (i.e., setting a value in the array) and using subscripting on the right-hand-side (i.e., getting a value in the array) both work. Thus, the method will be similar to both setItem(i) and getItem(i).\n\nNormally, the subscript operation on an array does not perform bounds checking on the index value i, but yours should perform bounds checking. More precisely, your subscript operator should throw a range_error if it is passed a “bad” index value.\nThe method should return a reference to the item in the array.\n\nHere is the algorithm:\nItem &operator[](unsigned index)\n    check if index is legal. If not, throw a range_error\n    return myArray[index];\nBecause the method is returning a reference to the item in the array, subscripting works for both sides of an assignment.\n\n\n2 - Const subscript\nIf a Vec object is defined as constant then indexing the array in the Vec must also be constant – i.e., it cannot allow code to change the array. In tests.cpp, see a function called testConstSubscript(). This function takes a const-ref parameter. The subscripting of that Vec parameter will require us to implement the const subscripting method. The code in the method is identical to the code you wrote in the previous step above, but it returns const Item &, and is a const method – i.e., has const on the end of the line. Implement that method now so that all subscripting tests pass.\n\n\n3 - Vector Addition\nThe expression:\nv3 = v1 + v2;\nshould set v3 == {3, 6, 9}, without leaking memory.\nWhen C++ compiles v1 + v2, it looks at the types of the values that surround the +. It sees that v1 is a Vec object, so it actually will call operator+() on the v1 object, passing v2 as the parameter. Thus, the prototype is Vec Vec::operator+(const Vec &rhs) const. v1 is the “this” object that operator+ is being called on. v2 is being passed in as the rhs (right-hand-side) parameter.\nThe implementation is quite simple: make sure the sizes of the two Vecs are the same. If not, throw an error of type invalid_argument. If they are the same, create a new Vec object (of the correct size) and loop, repeated adding the values from myArray[i] and rhs[i] together and putting the result into the new Vec object.\n\n\n4 - Vector Subtraction\nThe expression:\nv3 = v1 - v2;\nshould set v3 == {-1, -2, -3}, without leaking memory.\nTo make life easier for you, tests.cpp contains tests for each of these operations. Use these tests and test-driven development to build your operations. If you get your program to compile, but it fails a test and you cannot figure out what is wrong, use the debugger! If necessary, draw a memory diagram and trace through the execution of the problematic function one statement at a time, until you identify the logic error."

Boobyprize, whose hyper-spatial engines allow the ship and its crew to explore the universe. Current theories suggest that reality consists of 11 or more dimensions, so you need a program to help you navigate through an N-dimensional space.\nVectors can be used to store positions (and/or directional forces) in a coordinate system. Vectors of length 2 can be used to store 2-dimensional (x, y) information; vectors of length 3 can be used to store 3-dimensional (x, y, z) information; and so on. Your task is to write a program that:\n\nPrompts for and has the user enter the number of dimensions in their space, storing this number in a variable N, which it can then use to define vector objects.\nPrompts for and has the user enter a starting position in that space, and stores that position in a vector object sum.\nUses a loop that:\n\nprompts for and has the user enter a position (relative to their current position), and stores that position in a vector,\nadds that vector to the sum vector.\n\nThis loop should let the user enter an arbitrary number of positions.\nOutputs the starting position plus the final position (i.e., the sum of the positions from the accumulator-vector).\n\nFor example, if the user is in a 3-dimensional system, enters the starting point {0, 0, 0}, and then enters the following four 3-dimensional relative-positions:\n{0, 1, 0}\n{0, 0, 1}\n{1, 2, 3}\nthe program should then display the starting position ({0,0,0}) and the sum from the accumulator ({2, 3, 4}), which is the user’s final position within the 3-dimensional system.\nAs another example, if the user is navigating through a 5-dimensional space, enters {1, 0, 1, 0, 1} as the starting point, and enters three 5-dimensional relative-positions:\n{2, 2, 2, 2, 2}\n{-3, -3, -3, -3, -3}\nthe program should then display the starting position and the final position ({0, 0, 0, 0, 0}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may (if you wish) have your program display the starship’s new position each time it is updated, rather than just displaying the final position at the end.\n\n\nYour application should have the user enter the vectors in the format expected by your readFrom(istream&) method: numbers separated by whitespace. (It does not have to parse through curly-brace and comma characters.) Likewise, your application can display the starship’s position using the format provided by your writeTo(ostream&) method – numbers separated by spaces.\nTo get you well on your way, your repo contains App.cpp and App.h. These files provide most of what you have to implement to finish this project. Just implement the missing TODO parts.\nNow that you have addition implemented, you’ll need to uncomment the line in App.cpp that reads\nres = res + v;\nYou will have to edit main() in main.cpp to:\n\ncall the App() constructor, and then\non the resulting object, call run().\n\nCompile the program with make proj4 and execute the program by doing ./proj4."

    "text": "Step 0.2. Instructions\nIn this simulation, you can move your cursor around a two-dimensional “board” and create or delete one of 3 different “elements” – a square of sand, a drop of water, or a block of metal. Here is what happens when each element is created:\n\nMetal: it sticks to the board where you place it.\nSand: it falls down the board, stacking up on Metal or other Sand, or on the bottom. If Sand encounters water below it, the two switch places, so that it seems the sand is falling through the water.\nWater: it falls down the board and fills in any “cups” created by Metal or Sand, or resting on the bottom. If it encounters Metal, Sand, or Water below it, and there is nothing to the left or right of it, it moves sideways left or right, randomly. This makes the water flow around obstacles.\n\n\nIn the image above you can see how Sand stacks on top of Sand and Metal. The Water will fill in any area that is a “cup”. If one were to move the Cursor (the 6-point star) over above the Water that is in the cup in the middle and drop a Sand, it would slide down the board, falling through the Water, leaving a Water up above the level of the Sand. The Water would then randomly move back and forth until falling down to the bottom.\nThe user interface for the “game” is a little strange, IMO. You use arrow keys to move the cursor around – this should all work. Then, you choose W, A, S, or D to choose whether you are in Water mode, Metal mode, Sand mode, or Delete mode. When you hit the space bar, a Water, Metal, or Sand is created, or whatever the cursor on is deleted, if in Delete mode.\nNote that if you move the Cursor on top of a Metal and go into Sand mode, you can replace a metal with a sand – a little strange, but don’t worry about that – it isn’t a bug."

Then the user of the program can choose to:\n\nShow all movies\nShow all actors in a movie\nShow all movies an actor was in.\nThe main data structure you’ll create is an STL map that maps:\n\nmovie name → set of actors in the movie.\nThis is a complex data structure: each entry in the map contains a set (Thus, we’ll have a binary search tree of binary search trees).\nWe’ll use the Bridges database of movie information. When you get the information from the Bridges API, you get a vector of objects of type MovieActorWikidata. Each object contains a movie and an actor in the movie (among other things). If you printed out those two things from MovieActorWikidata objects, you might see these values.\nMovie: Young at Heart         Actor: Alan Hale, Jr.\nMovie: Wichita                Actor: Carl Benton Reid\nMovie: We're No Angels        Actor: Aldo Ray\nMovie: Young at Heart         Actor: Doris Day\nMovie: Wichita                Actor: Joel McCrea\netc...\nThus, you see that the objects are not in any order, and do not have all the actors in a movie in each object. To get all actors for a movie, you’ll have to iterate over all the elements of the vector and learn 1) all the movies, and 2) all the actors in the movies.\nNote that sometimes an actor is listed multiple times for a movie. But, because we are using an STL set, it automatically handles attempts to insert an element multiple times."

It should be evident that the maximum time to search is O(lg(n)), where n is the number of items in the set.\nThe exercise will provide you with a “skeleton” application, which you will then complete by adding additional functionality."

    "text": "Part I. The Menu Class\nWhen dealing with menu-driven systems, one thing that can go wrong is if the user enters an invalid choice – something that is not on the menu. When this happens, the program must detect it and take remedial action.\nOne way to detect such a problem is to build a Menu class that, besides “remembering” its menu, “remembers” its set of valid menu choices. Then when the user enters a choice, we can validate their choice by checking whether or not their choice is an element of that set.\nAs you can see, our Menu class contains two instance variables: a string storing the menu, and a set to store those menu choices that are valid:\nstring myValue;             // the menu that is displayed\nset&lt;char&gt; myValidChoices;   // the valid menu choices\nSave/compile your project, and verify that everything compiles without errors.\n\nThe Menu Constructor\nThe Menu constructor currently initializes our myValue member; it must also initialize myValidChoices so that it stores the valid menu choices. To do so, we can use the insert() method:\nsetVariable.insert(value);\nthat inserts a single value into a set.\nIn Menu.cpp, add insert() calls to make myValidChoices represent the set {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘q’}.\n\n\nThe Menu::containsChoice() Method\nTo let a program conveniently check whether or not a given character is a valid menu choice, the Menu class provides a boolean method containsChoice(choice) that returns true if and only if choice is a valid menu choice. Currently, this method is a stub-definition that returns false. Your next task is to revise this stub so that it returns true if and only if choice is in the set myValidChoices.\nWe can accomplish this using the find() method.\nSave/compile your project, and when it is free of compilation errors, run the program. When it is free of errors, go on.\nWhen you run your program, you will need to provide your Bridges UserName and Id on the command line: e.g.,\n./movies CS112StudentUsingBridges 123555666"

    "section": "Part II. The App Class",
    "text": "Part II. The App Class\nThe file App.h contains the declaration of class App. This class uses an STL map to store (movieName, set of actors) pairs:\nmap&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; movies_by_name;   // key is movie name; value is set of actors' names.\nNote that the code actually reads like this:\ndb_type movies_by_name;\nIn order to not have to type map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; too often, I created two typedefs at the top of App.h:\ntypedef map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; db_type;\ntypedef map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt;::iterator db_iter;\nNow, the code can use db_type and db_iter instead of map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt; and map&lt;string, set&lt;string&gt;&gt;::iterator, respectively. So much easier to type!\n\nConstructor\nThe App constructor has been defined for you. It takes a vector of MovieActorWikidata entries as a parameter.\nThe constructor code contains the algorithm you should implement to process these entries, building up entries in the movies_by_name map.\nIf you use the hint I gave in class about how accessing a map with [ ] will either create a new entry or update it if it already exists, then the body of the for loop is one line. Otherwise, the body is about 9 lines, and is very tricky code.\nWrite the code now. This code will be difficult to test until you implement the next step.\n\n\nShow All Movies Option\nImplement code for showAllMovies(), to iterate through all entries in movies_by_name, and print out the movie name and then iterate through all actors for that movie, printing them out. I’ve indented the actor’s name, so the output is more readable.\nYou might find it very useful to make the inner loop a separate function. I called that function showActorsInAMovie(). It takes an iterator “pointing” to an object from the movies_by_name collection, and iterates over the “second” field (a set), printing each actor in the set. If you implement this function, you’ll find you can use it again below.\nWhen you think your code is correct (for this and the previous step), try loading all movies from 1955 and printing them all out. The first movie should be:\nMovie: 5 Against the House\n        Alvy Moore\n        Brian Keith\n        George Cisar\n        Guy Madison\n        Hugh Sanders\n        Jean Willes\n        John Larch\n        John Zaremba\n        Kathryn Crosby\n        Kerwin Mathews\n        Kim Novak\n        Mark Hanna\n        Robert Sampson\n        William Conrad\nThe last movie you should see should look like this:\nMovie: Young at Heart\n        Alan Hale, Jr.\n        Doris Day\n        Dorothy Malone\n        Elisabeth Fraser\n        Ethel Barrymore\n        Frank Ferguson\n        Frank Sinatra\n        Gig Young\n        Lonny Chapman\n        Robert Keith\n\n\nShow All Actors For a Single Movie Option\nComplete the code in the getMovienameAndShowActors() method. If you created a function to show all actors for a given movie, then you are half done already.\n\n\nShow All Movies For an Actor Option\nFinally, implement this option. Create a set of strings (I called my variable movies_by_actor.) And then go through all movies, looking for that actor. When you find him/her, add the movie to the movies_by_actor. Then, when you are done, print out the set.\nHere is a sample output:\nEnter an actor name to show all movies for that actor: Alfred Hitchcock\nRear Window\nThe Trouble with Harry\nTo Catch a Thief"

You will be submitting multiple files each containing a main() in it.\nAccept the assignment.\n\n\n\n\nThis is going to take forever…"

Add the results for when \\(n\\) is 20 in a comment in the code at the bottom of the file.\nNow, ask the AI to modify the code to use memoization.
