Welcome to Database Management, a hands-on course designed to equip you with the essential skills for designing, querying, and optimizing relational databases. Over the next seven weeks, you'll dive into SQL, explore database structures, and gain practical experience in managing data efficiently. Whether you're new to databases or looking to sharpen your skills, this course will provide a solid foundation for real-world applications.

Get ready to write queries, design schemas, and discover how databases power modern applications! Looking forward to an exciting and engaging learning journey with you all.

See you in class!

## Student Learning Outcomes {.unnumered}

Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:

-   Use indirection (pointers) and run-time memory allocation to implement dynamic, generic container classes (e.g., vectors, lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.).\
-   Analyze, categorize, and compare the complexity of data structure operations using "big-oh" notation.\
-   Design and implement recursive data structure operations.\
-   Design, create, and use unit-tests to test the correctness of data structure operations.\
-   For select algorithms, use simple parallel computing techniques to improve algorithm performance and measure the improvement.

## Course Organization {.unnumbered}

The course is organized around these components:

1.  The lectures that will introduce data structures topics at the conceptual level;
2.  The labs in which students will (in pairs) practice using and building data structures; and
3.  The projects in which students will (individually) practice using and building data structures.

Each week's lectures, labs and projects will cover the same concepts, but will do so in different ways.

The first 4 weeks will be dedicated to learning C++. After that, we will begin studying data structures.
