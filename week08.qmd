## SLOs for Week 08

By the end of this unit, students will be able to...

- describe the concept of Big-Oh notation for analyzing algorithmic complexity.
- reason about how a Big-Oh notation is an approximation of the exact time complexity of an algorithm, expressed as $a * f(n) + b$.
- defend the argument that Big-Oh notation is a description of the carbon footprint of an algorithm, and thus, using better algorithms is a way for Christians to care for the earth.
- draw the lines/curves of typical Big-Oh values on a graph.
