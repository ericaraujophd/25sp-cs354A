    "Well-optimized SQL queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run faster\n",
    "* Reduce memory and CPU usage\n",
    "* Improve scalability for large datasets\n",

    "### 1. Use SELECT Only What You Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid `SELECT *` — only select necessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Bad\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Good\n",
    "SELECT order_id, order_date FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 In other DBMSs, `SELECT *` can even prevent index-only scans (e.g., PostgreSQL). In DBMSs like PostgreSQL, an index-only scan is a powerful optimization. It allows the database to read data directly from the index without having to access the full table (also called the heap). This is much faster, especially on large tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for this to work, two things must be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tAll the required columns must be in the index\n",
    "2.\tThere must be no need to access the actual table rows\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite** does not support index-only scans in the same way **PostgreSQL** does. So in SQLite, this specific optimization doesn’t apply — but it’s still a good habit to avoid SELECT * for performance and clarity."

    "### 2. Filter Early with WHERE\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply `WHERE` clauses to reduce the number of rows processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Bad\n",
    "SELECT customer_id FROM orders;\n",

    "### 3. Use Indexes Wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes speed up `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY`. But avoid over-indexing!\n",

    "-- Create index on order_date for filtering\n",

    "\n",
    "In PostgreSQL, you can use `EXPLAIN` to see if indexes are used. In SQLite, use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **index** is like a sorted list that a database uses to quickly find data in a table — similar to an index in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of scanning every row (called a full table scan), the database looks in the index to jump directly to the relevant rows, which is much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Key Points about Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speeds up WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY queries.\n",
    "* Uses extra disk space.\n",
    "* Too many indexes = slower inserts/updates (because all indexes need updating).\n",
    "* Best used on columns frequently used in filtering or joining."

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-important}\n",
